For all the goodwill that will come Ferguson’s way, his promotion is not a cause for celebration but a symbol of Everton’s malfunction under the erratic ownership of Farhad Moshiri. A club that has spent over £450m on players since Moshiri’s arrival finds itself in the bottom three and led by a sixth different coach in under four years. Chelsea will relish the opportunity.

They are unbeaten in 32 games – a club record – and can win with explosive attacking power or with defensive grit and determination. Bournemouth’s chances of even a point look grim considering their best player this season – Harry Wilson – is unavailable to face his parent club. Liverpool have won their last four meetings by an aggregate score of 14-0.

Top scorer Danny Ings is likely to be recalled, with teenager Michael Obafemi staking a claim to retain his place after a fantastic finish against Chelsea. That win means Southampton have twice as many away points (14) as they have earned at St Mary’s (seven). That statistic will need to change if Southampton are to stay clear of the relegation battle.

Dean Smith’s side are also showing a hint of long overdue form after their defeat of Norwich on Boxing Day, only their second win in 10 attempts. Pearson must decide whether to stick with Troy Deeney up front; the Watford captain’s fitness must be managed but he scored late winners against Villa twice in 2015-16 – the last season these teams were in the same division.

Giovani Lo Celso is likely to make his first start under Mourinho, while Dele Alli is a doubt with cramp.

This time the game is not at Anfield, Liverpool have the small matter of a 13-point lead and 18 games still to play but, well, there’s the narrative and Mourinho will not be shy of running with it. Despite his depleted Tottenham squad the Portuguese will indeed be desperate to inflict a first defeat of the season on Jürgen Klopp’s seemingly unstoppable side, as will his players who – lest we forget – lost a Champions League final to Liverpool fewer than eight months ago and were only beaten in the reverse fixture at Anfield in October by a controversial late penalty.

Dean Smith’s side have a respectable 14 points from eight games against teams in the bottom seven so panic must not set in despite residing in the danger zone. A huge boost is Pepe Reina’s arrival between the sticks. His 285 appearances in the Premier League for Liverpool will provide guidance for the second-worst defence in the league – one goal shy of conceding two goals per game. Brighton will hope Reina’s advancing years render him a spent force at 37. Brighton would be well-advised to try to test him severely.

Arsenal supporters will remember the “this is the day we are going to lose” mentality in the latter stages of the record 49-game streak in 2003-04. It could be a tricky looking away game, or perhaps an early kick-off, but usually it would just be against a bitter rival who you knew would enjoy ending your run more than anybody else. So it is entirely natural that Liverpool – unbeaten this season, unbeaten in 38 league matches and unbeaten in the league at Anfield since April 2017 – seem to be entertaining the fact they will lose to Manchester United on Sunday. True, United are the only team to take a point off Jürgen Klopp’s side this season courtesy of October’s 1-1 draw at Old Trafford but their inconsistent away form has seen them lose at Watford and Arsenal of late and there is little to suggest they can silence Anfield. Apart from the fact that this is football, of course.

Jamie Vardy suffered no ill-effects from his appearance off the bench at Villa so could be unleashed from the start on Saturday, which means Chelsea’s fragile central defence will have little room for error. Chelsea’s forwards have not been clinical enough this season and cannot afford to fritter away any chances they create at the King Power.

Eddie Howe’s side could climb out of danger with three points while dropping their rivals into trouble and a dip in form may be on the cards for Villa after the thrill of making the League Cup final. Mbwana Samatta’s first start in the Premier League will hopefully provide the goal threat Dean Smith’s side have lacked. Bournemouth have to put FA Cup defeat behind them and reproduce the performance that beat Brighton and snapped their six-match winless run.

Crystal Palace’s addition Cenk Tosun is missing with injury but Roy Hodgson welcomes back Andros Townsend and Christian Benteke from injury to cover the Turkish striker. Chris Wilder’s first win in the top flight was against Palace and the Blades can return to fifth place with another set of three points if results go their way. A tight game could be on the cards as Palace have neither scored or conceded more than twice in any of their 12 home games this season.

The worry is still end product in front of goal though and the need for those around Jack Grealish to match his endeavour. Brendan Rodgers’ anxiety will have been relieved by safe passage into the FA Cup quarter-finals and Jamie Vardy’s return to the side. Champions League qualification looks assured but another defeat to a struggling side would raise eyebrows.
