Mid-table had beckoned, but a wretched run-in (eight points from a possible 30) may have the powers that be considering a Gus Poyet-shaped replacement for their Dutch manager. In contrast, Swansea end their centenary season celebrating a trophy, assured of at least a 10th-place finish and delighted with Michael Laudrup's first season in the job.

But any notion that they might already have their minds on the beach has been scorched by Paolo Di Canio. The visitors will be up for this one and they will seek to derail Tottenham's Champions League dream which, admittedly, also needs help from Newcastle United. André Villas-Boas will rely on the noises from the crowd to keep him informed of Arsenal's fortunes at St James' Park and he will focus merely on the victory he needs. It will be tense.

This is the Scot's 1500th and final match in charge of Manchester United and he goes out on a suitable high – with his side as champions and chasing a club record 29 victories in a Premier League season. The hosts have already secured their best-ever Premier League points total (48).

That is an admirable achievement and in stark contrast to Reading's campaign. They came up as champions but have endured a difficult time back among the elite, with a change of manager not stopping their slide towards relegation. There will be one happy face within the visitors' ranks, however – goalkeeper Alex McCarthy, who has just been called up to England's senior squad.

Wigan's defeat at Arsenal on Tuesday night made survival a mathematical impossibility and ensured that their run of improbable escapes came to an end. At least the hosts can console themselves with the not inconsiderable achievement of winning the FA Cup and qualifying for the Europa League while Aston Villa will be looking to build on the steady improvement shown by Paul Lambert's youthful charges.
