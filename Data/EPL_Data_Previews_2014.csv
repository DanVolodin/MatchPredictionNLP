Dick Advocaat’s achievement in retaining Sunderland’s top flight status should be lauded. José Mourinho, the manager of the season, would have preferred to have hoisted the silverware after the victory over Crystal Palace earlier this month but will still savour the moment as he flings more youngsters into the fray to gain experience.
