The squad looks almost identical to last season’s so it is tough to see where improvement will come from. Whether Brighton can capitalise and find the goals they have been sorely missing to climb higher is the key conundrum for Graham Potter. Both managers will be acutely aware they must do better as this season’s crop of newcomers look more likely to pose a threat than the dead wood that allowed both sides to coast to safety in May.

Norwich have taken only two of the last 42 points on offer between the sides, conceding at least three goals in seven of their past nine meetings and a whopping five in three of the last eight. Still, Daniel Farke’s side will feel under less pressure to make an immediate impact and Liverpool’s midfield remains a relatively unknown quantity since Georginio Wijnaldum’s departure. The Kosovan international Milot Rashica is an exciting home addition and could give the Reds something to think about at left-back in the absence of Andy Robertson. Kostas Tsimikas will hope for a rare chance but with an embarrassment of riches at centre-back now fit and available following last season’s injury nightmares, Klopp does have the option of changing formation to start three of them.

Shortly afterwards Joelinton arrived on Tyneside for £40m and it will be intriguing in due course to see if Howe can unlock the Brazilian’s talent.

Leicester, by contrast, have been rather fragile recently and were booed off after last week’s defeat by Chelsea, but Thursday’s encouraging win in the Europa League may have restored some belief.

Indeed if Newcastle fail to secure their first win of the season then relegation will start to look increasingly inevitable. Unfortunately Howe’s record against Sean Dyche’s team does not inspire great confidence. Newcastle’s manager can only hope for another stellar performance from Joelinton. Apparently reborn under his management, the £40m Brazilian striker excelled in an often defensive midfield role after Ciaran Clark’s early sending-off during Tuesday’s draw with Norwich and he may well end up being reinvented as a No 8.

The visitors have won three of the four matches under their new manager while Liverpool can equal a club record of scoring in 31 successive games, set as a Division Two side between April 1957 and January 1958, should they find the target again.

Pep Guardiola’s side look almost unstoppable and Arsenal’s much-improved defence will still be highly overmatched, with Phil Foden, Kevin De Bruyne, Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling (you get the idea) flexing their considerable creative prowess.

The Nigeria forward scored his eighth goal of the season in Watford’s 4-1 defeat against West Ham on Tuesday – their fifth successive loss. His availability in January offers hope but their problems remain in defence. Watford’s inability to keep a clean sheet is likely to be exposed again by a rejuvenated Tottenham. Antonio Conte remains unbeaten in the league and his arrival has reinvigorated Harry Kane after a forgettable autumn.

However, Wolves are also enjoying a nice run of form and will hope Roman Saïss’s departure to the Africa Cup of Nations does not harm their ironclad defence. Only 14 goals conceded after 19 games is remarkable and Manchester City are the sole side who have a better record, with 13. Ralph Hasenhüttl will be meticulously planning how to break his opponents down and he can focus his side on this task as Wolves’ achilles heel is a lack of creativity.

The fortunate 1-0 win over Aston Villa in the FA Cup on Monday was the latest example of how disjointed the team are but also meant United have lost once in 10 games under their interim manager. Scoring goals remains a problem but the return of Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho from injury should give them more of a cutting edge.

Tuesday’s defeat at Newcastle enabled Lampard to see first hand what Evertonians have known for too long – they have an error-prone team lacking in character. An alarming mix for a relegation fight.

Only Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City have lost fewer than Brighton’s tally of four. They restart after a three-week break without Dan Burn’s significant presence but with Graham Potter’s superior coaching it is unlikely to break the spell against Watford. Adam Webster has stepped up to replace Ben White so one imagines Potter has another in mind to burst on to the scene, or maybe just good old Lewis Dunk. Roy Hodgson’s side are in desperate need of a win after a run of 10 matches since their last under Claudio Ranieri but their mishmash of a squad is unlikely to pose too much of a threat to Brighton’s slimline but efficient side.

That push will be helped by the fact that, in a rare occurrence this season, Lage has an almost fully fit squad to pick from this weekend.

Burnley have gone from the darkest depths of the table to three points from safety in the space of two brilliant performances. Sean Dyche’s side seemed to have forgotten themselves but Wout Weghorst’s destruction of Brighton and a masterful 1-0 over an over-confident Tottenham has them back grinding for survival. A third successive win (last seen in April 2019) could incredibly move them out of danger. So can Crystal Palace survive an encounter with this reconfigured behemoth? Patrick Vieira’s only recent successes have come when punching down and after putting four past Watford the Frenchman will hope he has found an attacking combination that truly clicks after Palace’s early fire appeared extinguished.

With all the turmoil surrounding Roman Abramovich’s sale of Chelsea, one could argue there is no better time to try to catch them off guard. Luton almost did on Wednesday in the Cup but it is fairly likely that Thomas Tuchel’s team talk at half-time reminded Chelsea of their status.

The criticism of Graham Potter’s side has remained the same throughout his tenure – they do not score enough. One goal and four defeats from their past four matches underlines this neatly. Liverpool should be able to handle their business comprehensively, then, as they continue to chase Manchester City in the title race.

Was it mere coincidence they scored more than one goal in a game for the first time in 10 matches with Christian Eriksen in midfield? We more than likely will find out against fellow relegation contenders Burnley. If any match is likely to need some creative magic to unlock a defence it is one against Sean Dyche’s obdurate side. The incentive for victory is huge, Brentford could open a relatively whopping nine-point gap over the relegation zone with three points. The spoils are equally tantalising, of course, for Burnley.

Patrick Vieira’s side are also in good form with just one defeat in eight but they will need to lift their levels even higher against a City team that have taken 35 from a possible 42 points on their travels this season.

Mikel Arteta’s side simply lack the strength in depth of the Reds and a striker who can finish their slick moves; Alexandre Lacazette would likely be Jürgen Klopp’s sixth best option in attack if he were to switch allegiances. Regardless Arsenal have a good chance to continue their mission to clinch fourth spot against Aston Villa. The high likelihood of Bukayo Saka bearing down on Ashley Young feels like an avenue to instant success as Lucas Digne looks set to miss out. Villa will also be disappointed if former Gunner Callum Chambers is out with a head injury as he has proved an instant hit for Steven Gerrard. A depleted defence may not be enough though as Arteta has made a lot of noise about Arsenal’s exhaustion and if he is not just blowing smoke then Philippe Coutinho’s magic could derail the manager’s best laid plans further.

Wolves are another hard-nosed unit but struggle to score without Raúl Jiménez in the lineup. With the striker suspended, Villa have a cracking opportunity to earn some payback.

A chest-thumpingly heartening comeback victory, complete with late winner, against fellow relegation-threatened Everton in midweek could be the spark that lights Sean Dyche’s rocket ship to safety. To keep his side’s trajectory stable, this has the feel of an absolute must-win, both to keep momentum going and to heap further pressure on Frank Lampard’s side. For Norwich, winless in all competitions since 5 February and with only two points from the last 24 available, 30 points remains a miserably distant target with eight games remaining, never mind the 40 traditionally viewed as sufficient for survival.

At lunchtime Spurs will almost definitely dispatch a Brighton side that embarrassed Arsenal last time out so to keep pace they simply have to beat Southampton in a 3pm kick-off. Fortunately they face a Saints side without a win in five matches so if Arsenal show up and play with an ounce of positivity then Ralph Hasenhüttl’s usual forward-thinking approach should allow for plenty of chances. Chances have so often gone unfinished this season, however. Southampton have hope to end their poor run with Arsenal’s profligate nature likely to improve only once the transfer window opens.

Things have changed plenty since the heady reigns of Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger, however, and Saturday’s early kick-off is reduced to a scuffle to remain in contention for fourth spot. If United – who will be boosted by the return of Cristiano Ronaldo – fail to improve on a dismal run of two wins in seven games their hopes will be virtually over. The picture looks a lot brighter for Arsenal after their victory at Chelsea in midweek and a win for Mikel Arteta’s side would put the pressure firmly back on Tottenham.

Eddie Howe will be targeting a top-half finish and what better team to notch up a fourth successive win against than Norwich. Dean Smith’s side showed tremendous fight in defeat against Manchester United last time out but arguably Newcastle will pose a much more difficult proposition. They are a team in sync compared to one carried solely on Cristiano Ronaldo’s shoulders. A Norwich win would close the gap to six points from the last safe spot with five games to play, until Burnley attempt to jump out of danger against Wolves on Sunday.

Eddie Howe – with the help of a considerable amount of money – has transformed Newcastle from relegation fodder to the Premier League’s most upwardly mobile team. Four wins on the spin has lifted them to ninth and they are an even tougher proposition at home where they have won their past six. That is unlikely to prove too daunting for a Liverpool side boosted by the news of Jürgen Klopp’s contract extension and who have won 13 of their past 14 in the league – the only blip a 2-2 draw with City – while going unbeaten since 28 December.

Their fate is not yet sealed but if they lose against Aston Villa and Burnley beat Watford then they will be officially a Championship side next term. Steven Gerrard has backed Philippe Coutinho to find his best form as Villa are most likely considering whether or not the Brazilian is worth signing permanently.

Ralph Hasenhüttl and Patrick Vieira will be assessing their squads for a summer shakeup as each have talent at their disposal and have impressed on occasion but are 13th and 14th respectively due to inconsistent performances. One of Vieira’s biggest headaches will be replacing the on-loan Conor Gallagher’s brilliance in midfield next term. Players will be aware they are potentially playing for their futures but another club will always coming knocking so with no real skin in the game this one could be fairly low in the Match of the Day pecking order come Saturday night.

So sit back and ready your finest sweet and salted popped corn as Watford try and find inspiration in the grimmest of pictures. Win all of your final five games and your fate is still not in your own hands. A win for Burnley takes Watford to all but gone territory as they can draw level with the Clarets only if they win their four remaining games. Roy Hodgson’s side could take the first step on the road to the greatest of all escapes against Burnley but after losing their past four in succession it would come as a big surprise.

Graham Potter’s side are only a point above Southampton in 13th so will be hungry to return to winning ways. Yves Bissouma coming back from suspension to strengthen their spine makes this task a lot more palatable. Wolves will look at the table and think what might have been with a little more luck on their side this season but finishing sixth is still within reach. Bruno Lage’s side are six points behind Manchester United but have two games in hand. A win over Brighton could spark a dramatic flurry but that Rúben Neves shaped hole may continue to harm their form.

Leeds are a far more organised side under Jesse Marsch than the one brushed aside 6-0 at Anfield in the penultimate game of Marcelo Bielsa’s reign. The fact Leeds are also still in a relegation battle – despite taking 11 points from their past five games – will also make the task tougher for Pep Guardiola’s side who could have one eye on Wednesday’s Champions League second leg at Real Madrid. City thumped Leeds 7-0 at the Etihad in December but Guardiola would bite your hand off for a scrappy 1-0 win at Elland Road.

It is a little surprising they are still in contention for a top-four finish but those ambitions will wither unless they can string a run together between now and the end of the season. With a trip to Anfield next up and a potential showdown with Arsenal at home on the horizon anything less than victory against a Leicester side distracted by the return leg against Roma in the Europa Conference League on Thursday could prove terminal.

Their top-four hopes have evaporated and they need to overturn a 2-1 Europa League semi-final deficit at Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday. Fighting on two fronts has taken its toll with David Moyes already without three first choice centre-backs in the injured Issa Diop and Angelo Ogbonna and suspended Craig Dawson.

No one would have predicted them moving from four points adrift to sitting two points above Everton in 16th. Aston Villa now stand in their way to salvation in all likelihood as the fixture gods present a strange scenario where they face each other home and away in the next two weeks. Villa naturally beat Norwich last time out but with a first win in six matches so Burnley should not be too fazed by the challenge. The scale of the achievement for Mike Jackson if they are successful is clear, it would be a first run of four league wins for the club since 2018.

Granted, for Spurs to have a realistic chance they will need to beat Liverpool on Saturday so Chelsea should be fine, but the wheels could still fall off with the sale of the club still in limbo. Fortunately their chances of staying third until the season’s end are boosted by facing Wolves. No goals in a run of three defeats suggests Bruno Lage’s side have somewhat checked out on the campaign and may be looking forward to a hard-earned rest. Thomas Tuchel will be in the mood to give them anything but. Graham Searles",2022-05-06,chelsea,wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/06/chelsea-wolves-match-preview-premier-league

They do have some hope against Crystal Palace, though, as their away form has produced almost three-quarters of their points tally.

Rather than challenging for the title or pushing for a Champions League spot Manchester United still need points to make sure of a Europa League place and avoid the Europa Conference. Brighton – ninth but only four points above Southampton in 15th – are seeking a highest top flight finish since they came 13th in the old First Division in 1982. To inch closer to their goals both must improve on recent form with Brighton having failed to win at home in their last eight and United losing their past four away matches in the Premier League. Cristiano Ronaldo also needs two goals to reach 700 in club football.

After an inconsistent loan spell Aston Villa will hope the creative force can refind his magic touch next season after a summer in which he can bed in fully. Steven Gerrard’s side fought hard, arguably deserving a point, in defeat to Liverpool in midweek and will be hopeful they can still secure a top-half finish if they pick up where they left off, starting with Crystal Palace. Patrick Vieira will undoubtedly feel the same and the Frenchman has the fine wind of good form at his back.

It is not that they ever looked nailed on to survive but the manner of their past two ill-tempered, dismal defeats is potentially sounding their top-flight death knell. The squad is shattering with injuries and suspensions at a crucial time while Patrick Bamford remains a doubt to appear. One wonders how they might have fared with his goals and creativity splashed throughout the campaign. A win against in-form Brighton would be incredible for Jesse Marsch but a point would still lift them out of the bottom three if Burnley have lost at Tottenham earlier on Sunday.

It was Vardy’s first 90 minutes in the league for Leicester since 28 December after hamstring and knee injuries ravaged this year for the striker. Lucky for him relegated Watford are the next team up and he will no doubt be eyeing up another tension-releasing onslaught in front of goal. Brendan Rodgers will surely be looking at long-term replacements for Vardy if the manager himself intends to stick around at the King Power for the long haul.

They sit just inside the top half on 48 points and will be very keen to avoid being knocked out by Brentford, Crystal Palace, Newcastle and Aston Villa. A win against West Ham seals the deal and a point might do the trick but with four teams chasing it might be wise for Graham Potter’s side to go all guns blazing. They could even jump as high as eighth if results go their way. David Moyes is likely to deploy similar tactics as West Ham will be eager to overhaul Manchester United in sixth and qualify for the Europa League.

Mike Jackson’s side have a differential of 20 in their favour so their fate is very much in their own hands. Win and Burnley are in the top flight for another season. Unfortunately beating Newcastle is a huge task at present: leaving aside predictable losses to Manchester City and Liverpool, they have won their past five matches and the manner in which they easily dispatched an Arsenal side who desperately needed a win on Monday after those defeats is likely to make Burnley fans very nervous.

A win against Crystal Palace secures the second tier competition but if West Ham win and Manchester United lose or draw then to the conference they will go owing to their vastly inferior goal difference. Palace can still finish in the top half but a large number of results will have to go in their favour so a positive season may finish with a small whimper. Patrick Vieira’s Palace have certainly passed the eye test but in practice they may finish only one point and one place better off than last season if they lose against United.
