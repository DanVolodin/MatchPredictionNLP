As a one-time Sunderland forward Bent is not popular on Gallowgate, from where home fans will watch his intriguing duel with Fabricio Coloccini. Alan Pardew hopes to offer Papisss Demba Cissé, Newcastle's new signing from Freiburg, a debut, quite possibly alongside his Senegal strike partner Demba Ba.

A win will all but guarantee their first title since 1968 and it is difficult to see them losing their way given this is a contest between the team with the best home record in the league against the side with the least away points. City's biggest opponent might be anxiety but Roberto Mancini's team are a solid bunch, which means fourth-from-bottom QPR may have to rely on Stoke avoiding defeat against Bolton to avoid dropping into the relegation places. A lot is being made about Mancini and Mark Hughes renewing hostilities but, for both managers, there are greater issues at stake.

Paul Lambert has called for his side to put on a good display at Carrow Road after back-to-back home defeats because ""too many come to watch us (not to perform)"", while Alex McLeish must be feeling the pressure after a dire first full season at Villa.

The mission for Bolton remains simple – a win on Sunday will keep them up, unless QPR poop Manchester City's title party. But winning at the Britannia Stadium is far easier said than done, and Owen Coyle has fitness concerns over the midfield trio Mark Davies, Nigel Reo-Coker and Darren Pratley.

That outcome is unlikely but they must seek a win at Sunderland and hope, in particular, to take an early lead that puts strain on Manchester City, who top the table solely on goal difference.

At a club that has won 18 titles and five European Cups, the Carling Cup and eighth place doesn't quite cut it, as Dalglish well knows. There are many who would like to see a younger, more modern manager at Anfield, someone not unlike Swansea's Brendan Rodgers, who will hope to end a hugely satisfying season with another big scalp on Sunday.
