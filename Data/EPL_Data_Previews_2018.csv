Arsenal showed signs they are beginning to adapt to his attacking style against Chelsea but defensive demons will take longer to cleanse. One positive has been Mattéo Guendouzi’s impressive jump from Ligue 2 to the Premier League. The 19-year-old has the highest total combined interceptions and tackles of any player so far. With his growing presence Arsenal now have a first chance to stamp their authority against a West Ham side that have also lost both of their opening fixtures.
