Arsène Wenger's team will nevertheless have to summon more penetration and concentration than they have shown recently if they are to get the result that will prevent Spurs from leapfrogging into third place. That motivation and the fact that Fulham are not the sort of side to test Lukasz Fabianski with an aerial bombardment should help them secure what they need.
