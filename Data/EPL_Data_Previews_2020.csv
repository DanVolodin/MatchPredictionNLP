Smith’s revolutionised defence is in for a serious test to stop Liverpool racking up a fourth win in four.

Motivation may be totally irrelevant, though, as Arsenal seem to have skewed too heavily toward preventing goals. Yes, conceding two against Manchester City, Leicester and Manchester United is an amazing upgrade but scoring one in that period feels far too meagre for long-term success. Spain’s own George Graham will be unconcerned with stats, though, and focused on driving his side to feed off the victory at Old Trafford.

Life has been a little tougher at Villa Park though – Liverpool demolition aside – and Dean Smith is likely to have warned his team against overconfidence. Graham Potter’s side have flashed in attack in spots this season but have struggled for creativity recently with three goals in their past four matches. The logic behind counting on a proven poor finisher in Danny Welbeck and an ageing Adam Lallana should be questioned. On the flip side Lewis Dunk’s return strengthens an already stout defence that could limit Villa’s relative potency.

Chelsea and Tottenham have been electric so far this season while there was more than a little spark between Frank Lampard and José Mourinho when these sides met in the League Cup in September. Spurs could make a serious title statement with following up a win against Manchester City with another success at Stamford Bridge. Lampard’s side meanwhile can leapfrog Mourinho if they hold firm at home. Édouard Mendy may have a huge part to play in the outcome as his seven clean sheets in 10 games have transformed Lampard’s leaky defence. Maybe Mendy is the man who can finally halt the relentless goalscoring machine of Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.

Maybe Brighton are the team they can finally topple to end that horrific run as Graham Potter’s side are struggling for goals, with two in their past four matches while failing to win any of them. Confidence will likely be in desperately short supply on the team bus to the Amex and Potter will be hoping to guide his side to a much-needed win to stay above danger before facing high-flying West Ham.

Under Bielsa, Leeds might now be a favourite of the neutral (what a rebrand!) and they will look to rush men forward.

Albion, meanwhile, are five points from safety and have the worst goal difference in the division so will have no doubts that they are involved in the struggle to avoid demotion to the Championship. Sam Allardyce’s first three games have seen a highly creditable point at Liverpool sandwiched by home humiliations at the hands of Aston Villa and Leeds. If the hosts can take anything from this match it will offer encouragement before the January transfer window opens and Allardyce can indulge in some much needed strengthening of the squad.

At a time when he remains under intense pressure from Newcastle supporters who would like nothing better than to see him replaced by his still-adored predecessor, Rafael Benítez, Bruce could do with avoiding a similar new year mauling at the hands of Brendan Rodgers’s high flyers.

Ralph Hassenhüttl’s side have lost only once on their travels this season and could climb above Leicester with a win. But with Danny Ings absent that seems an unlikely outcome even if Leicester have found the going curiously tough at home, winning only three of eight matches.

Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side are unbeaten in 15 away league games since losing at Liverpool almost exactly one year ago and will go six points clear of them should they inflict a first home league defeat on the champions since April 2017.

A similar affair looks likely unless the home side strike early: the Magpies are adept when asked to sit in but, as they showed at Sheffield United, a more proactive approach appears to be beyond them. Arsenal’s turgid draw with Crystal Palace showed their improved form has not cured everything; they will hope Kieran Tierney and Gabriel Martinelli, driving forces of late, are able to return from injuries on schedule.

Wolves are winless in seven with their dive down the table coinciding with Raúl Jimenéz’s absence. The striker remains unavailable as he recovers from a head injury. Wolves have not been the same without him and Hodgson will be confident his side can improve markedly on the 1-0 defeat in the Cup.

The champions were excellent as they won for the first time in five league games. Yet their problems at centre-back increased when Joël Matip went off with an ankle problem and their injuries in defence could make life difficult against West Ham, who are two points behind Liverpool in fourth place. West Ham, who could name Jesse Lingard in their squad, will feel confident if Michail Antonio is in the mood.

Kane has not only provided 12 goals but has also been a driving creative force for José Mournho. The striker has the most assists in the league with 11. How Mourinho schemes to beat Brighton without his talisman will be interesting to see. A dream scenario for Graham Potter’s side would be snatching an early goal to dent Tottenham’s confidence even further. Heads will be harder to lift without Kane’s presence.

The result that started it was delivered by Aston Villa, a chastening 3-0 loss at the Emirates in early November when all the attacking vibrancy Dean Smith’s side have exhibited this season was on display in the form of young English talent such as Ollie Watkins, Ross Barkley and Jack Grealish. Arteta’s homegrown English youngsters Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka have helped dig Arsenal out of that hole and they can climb above Villa with victory on Saturday, although will have to do so without the suspended pair of David Luiz and hitherto ever-present goalkeeper Bernd Leno. Villa were also beaten in midweek at home by West Ham and Smith will be keen to ensure their surprisingly good form in the first half of the season does not fall away.

An injury induced defensive crisis is doing little to assuage the home manager’s nerves – even if Allan Saint-Maximin is finally fit to start in attack and the Arsenal loanee Joe Willock could make his debut in midfield.

Jesse Lingard’s arrival provided instant success as David Moyes’ knocked off Aston Villa with ease thanks to two goals from the Manchester United loanee. The big problem for Scott Parker is lack of goals. A tally of 17 from 21 matches is poor.

Carlo Ancelotti’s team have lost four of their past five Premier League home games, including 2-0 defeats by Fulham and Newcastle, and Southampton offer another test of what the Italian suspects is complacency among his players when facing struggling sides.

They are much less threatening without the playmaker but goals were drying up shortly before his injury too. Five in their past seven compared with 33 in 18 matches preceding the lean spell should give Nuno Espírito Santo further confidence. Wolves have hardly been prolific themselves but a victory over their West Midlands rivals, also still missing the key defender Matty Cash, could be all the incentive they need.

On form Newcastle are in rough shape with only two wins in their past 15 league games. They are in even rougher shape when injuries come into play. Bruce is missing Callum Wilson, Miguel Almirón and Allan Saint-Maximin, his only threatening players in attack.

That would have been hard to envisage when Newcastle won convincingly in east London at the start of the season. But back then few could have imagined that a Bruce ensemble propelled by the attacking skills of Callum Wilson and Allan Saint-Maximin would end up in a relegation skirmish. Injuries to that pair represent a big reason why Newcastle continue to look nervously over their shoulder but with the two forwards restored to full fitness they have reason for cautious optimism that they may have opened up a nine-point advantage on relegation rivals Fulham by the time the final whistle blows.

The bigger picture of the European Super League fiasco is a grim one but small thanks should be paid to Chelsea for firing up their rivals as a win for West Ham would leapfrog them above the breakaway boys into fourth. Just thinking about the prospect raises a smile. The task for David Moyes is a tough one though without Declan Rice to martial a midfield loaded with quality on the other side of the ball. Jesse Lingard is in incredible form though and a goal or two from him could be enough with Chelsea scoring only once in their past three matches in all competitions.

Injuries are starting to bite, however, with the loss of Declan Rice in central midfield the most significant although both he and Michail Antonio, scorer of the winning goal when these sides met in east London in January, have a chance of returning on Monday. Burnley have been buoyed by their magnificent and unlikely 4-0 win at Wolves which has mostly banished their relegation fears, but the arch-pragmatist Sean Dyche is unlikely to be letting his players think along those lines.

Or that Tottenham’s hopes of European qualification could rest on victory in West Yorkshire. Much may hinge on whether Harry Kane or Patrick Bamford triumphs in a much anticipated battle of two strikers whose importance to their respective teams simply cannot be underestimated.

It is fair to say Turf Moor’s ‘ginger Mourinho’ has a rather different philosophy to the man in the opposite dugout on Saturday, Marcelo Bielsa, but there will certainly be mutual respect between the pair whose sides both play to their strengths and are united by a fierce work ethic. The way Leeds dismantled Tottenham at Elland Road last weekend showed that Bielsa’s hard-running style has, despite some doubts, lasted until May. A European place looks beyond Leeds, but a top-half finish will be just reward for their fine season. The only doubts now will be whether both managers will still be in situ come next season, or if they will be tempted away by suitors who would find their achievements on limited budgets hard to ignore.

Having won just three of their last 25 games and five in total Scott Parker and his side cannot really complain, but there are many neutrals who will be sad to see them go given their enterprising attacking game. Premier League scouts will be circling around the likes of André-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Tosin Adarabioyo but given the volume of players on loan Parker will want to hang on to his leading lights if he is to fashion an instant return. Danny Ings was on target in that midweek win and while the striker may not be a Southampton player for much longer, on Saturday he will again likely exhibit the kind of lethal finishing that Fulham, for all their good intent, could not muster this season.

With a fifth consecutive season in the top flight to look forward to the shackles may be off for the hosts but West Ham arrive on the south coast with much to play for. Last week’s defeat to Everton was perhaps a fatal blow to their top-four hopes, but a Europa League or Europa Conference place is still very much in their grasp if they can win their final three games. A word of caution to David Moyes, however: West Ham have failed to beat Brighton in all seven previous top-flight meetings since the Seagulls came up in 2017.

Villa struggled in front of goal in the 0-0 draw with Everton on Thursday so the return of Watkins, who was serving a one-match ban after his sending off against Leeds, will be a welcome one for Dean Smith. Palace could make changes to the side that lost 3-1 to Southampton on Tuesday but Christian Benteke, who has found goalscoring form towards the end of the campaign, is expected to retain his place in attack. A large proportion of Roy Hodgson’s squad are out of contract in the summer and, with Premier League safety secured, they have an opportunity to impress potential new employers.

Who will the next manager be? Will Harry Kane stay? And, most urgently: is there any way Spurs can manage to not finish seventh and therefore qualify for Uefa’s new Europa Conference League? The simple solution to that last question is to keep playing as badly as they did at Leeds last weekend and Everton, West Ham or (God forbid) even Arsenal could yet claim that dubious privilege. The answer to the first question is the most pressing, and may also provide the solution to Kane’s future. The man in the opposite dugout on Sunday, Wolves’ Nuno Espírito Santo, has been mentioned as a potential candidate. Then again, there have been already been a few of those. Ryan Mason is recovering from the considerable shock of being handed a Wembley cup final against the champions-elect as his first ever game in charge of a football team, but is clearly holding the fort until the summer. Just don’t finish seventh, Ryan, and you may even end up with the permanent gig.

Given third- and fourth-placed Leicester and Chelsea meet on Tuesday, Klopp knows that three wins will probably be enough for his side to leapfrog one of them come the final Sunday and secure Champions League football. Given his side’s form this season that cannot be considered a foregone conclusion, yet there were signs in the 4-2 win over United of the departing champions being a potent attacking force again. West Brom, relegated by last Sunday’s defeat at Arsenal, have nothing but pride to play for but Sam Allardyce rarely turns down the opportunity to bloody the nose of one of the bigger clubs.

Nor could Jürgen Klopp, for that matter. But, after collecting 23 points from the last 27 available, his team will be in the Champions League next season with three more against an opponent they beat 7-0 five months ago. Klopp has won more Premier League games against Crystal Palace than any other team (9) and an Anfield crowd would take more satisfaction than most in ruining Roy Hodgson’s farewell to top-flight management.

Fans will be eager to see how the Canadian fares against a naturally rugged Burnley side that has earned another season in the Premier League. Sean Dyche has shown he is a master of achieving a great deal with meagre resources once again. He may not be pretty but damn it, he gets results.

Nuno Espírito Santo is waving goodbye to Wolverhampton. Yes, its bye-bye Black Country, auf wiedersehen West Midlands. The M54 beckons to pastures that may be distinctly based in north London. But enough speculation, Nuno’s fine four seasons have completely transformed the club and brought a wonderful Portuguese flavour to Wolves. One that has made the club a force in the Premier League and the fans can only hope it lives on after he departs. Some ugly crying may be the required tonic over a Pastel de Nata or two when the dust finally settles.
