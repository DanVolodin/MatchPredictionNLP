Then there is the ex-Sunderland captain Dean Whitehead. How he will relish his likely duel with the man who replaced him, Lee Cattermole. It will be intriguing to see whether Bruce manages to accommodate Asamoah Gyan, his Ghana striker and record £13m signing in today's starting line up.

Then in charge of a defeated West Ham side, Pardew was seen as a rising star before hitting a dramatic downward trajectory that would later take him to Charlton and Southampton. No one knows whether this represents the start of Pardew's road to redemption but Liverpool will trust the home supporters, horrified by Chris Hughton's sacking remain mutinous and the players numb.

Beat Arsenal and Fulham could leapfrog Everton and equal their highest ever Premier League finish, thereby enabling Hughes to prove that he has successfully replaced Roy Hodgson. In addition, Hughes has introduced a spirit of adventure into Fulham's play that was not always there under his predecessor, which means this match could be one of the most entertaining of the weekend, especially as Arsenal will be looking to win in order to climb back above Manchester City and avoid the Champions League qualifying-round next season.

The hosts are aiming to go through the entire season unbeaten at home, while the visitors are looking to pick up their first victory at Old Trafford in 49 years. It hardly helps their cause that Sir Alex Ferguson has said he will field a strong team, but Ian Holloway's men could still lose and stay up – and therefore play in the Premier League for a second successive season – should Birmingham, away at Tottenham, lose by a bigger margin.

Who could have guessed the season's final day would see Pardew welcome Hodgson to St James' Park?

Wigan have been pleasing on the eye yet vulnerable in defence all season, particularly at set-pieces, and Stoke is not the place to take such weaknesses. In Charles N'Zogbia, however, they possess a cutting edge to compensate and will hope to encounter a Stoke side bruised from two defeats to Manchester City but slapping themselves on the back for a campaign well done.Not that Tony Pulis will countenance any self-congratulation until the final whistle.
