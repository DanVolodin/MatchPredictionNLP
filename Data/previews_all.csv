"Leicester host Southampton in a game that could be perceived as a dead rubber but for Brendan Rodgers it is a chance to finish a challenging season on a high. Victory at home to Southampton could be enough to secure eighth, which Rodgers maintains would be an impressive achievement all things considered, his side reaching the semi-finals of the inaugural Europa Conference League. Meanwhile, a first win in six games would lift the mood at Southampton before the summer. “Apart from the top six and West Ham being above us, who have supposedly had a fantastic season, then it shows you how well these players have done,” Rodgers said.

"So it all comes down to 90 minutes of football to decide if Manchester City retain the championship for a second time in their history and for a second time under Pep Guardiola – if they beat Aston Villa. The visitors are managed by Steven Gerrard who, given his Liverpool loyalties, will surely celebrate a little more if his team beat Pep Guardiola’s and Jürgen Klopp’s side defeat Wolves to take the title.

"Manchester United’s dire season – a Premier League club record low points tally of 61 is the best they can hope for – still has room to develop into an armageddon of mind-melting proportions if they slip from a Europa League qualification spot into the Europa Conference League. A win against Crystal Palace secures the second tier competition but if West Ham win and Manchester United lose or draw then to the conference they will go owing to their vastly inferior goal difference. Palace can still finish in the top half but a large number of results will have to go in their favour so a positive season may finish with a small whimper. Patrick Vieira’s Palace have certainly passed the eye test but in practice they may finish only one point and one place better off than last season if they lose against United. Vieira’s sophomore effort will make interesting viewing, especially how he replaces the large Conor Gallagher-shaped hole in midfield.

Tottenham may have a reputation for flakiness but surely even they cannot grasp failure from the jaws of success on this occasion. A draw against a Norwich side that have lost 11 of their last 14 league matches will be enough to secure the final Champions League spot ahead of Arsenal – assuming their north London rivals fail to win by more than 15 against demob-happy Everton. Harry Kane is expected to be available after a virus and he and Son Heung-min will be relishing facing a defence that has leaked 79 goals this season – the most in the division. Norwich have nothing to play for but pride and the chance to leapfrog Watford and avoid finishing bottom for the second time in three seasons.

"Brentford can reflect on an expertly navigated first Premier League season, in which they sit 11th. That is two places lower than Leeds’ finish in 2020-21 and they will want to avoid mimicking what came next for Jesse Marsch’s side. The equation for Leeds is simple: they must get a positive result and hope Burnley gain fewer points than them at home to Newcastle. Survival is not in their hands and Marsch may rush Patrick Bamford back from injury in order to help them complete their side of the bargain.

"A week ago, this had threatened to be a knife-edge affair for both teams. The reality will be very different unless Arsenal learn Norwich are doing them an almighty favour against Tottenham; they need to do their bit just in case but it may be hard for Mikel Arteta’s players to lift themselves after letting the initiative slip in their battle for fourth. Everton, on the other hand, have achieved their modest goal of staying up: perhaps they will be minded to cruise, or maybe Frank Lampard will urge them to show they can compete with the bigger boys next season.

"Brighton are playing with house money as they have already set a club record Premier League points tally. They sit just inside the top half on 48 points and will be very keen to avoid being knocked out by Brentford, Crystal Palace, Newcastle and Aston Villa. A win against West Ham seals the deal and a point might do the trick but with four teams chasing it might be wise for Graham Potter’s side to go all guns blazing. They could even jump as high as eighth if results go their way. David Moyes is likely to deploy similar tactics as West Ham will be eager to overhaul Manchester United in sixth and qualify for the Europa League. The form book lies in Brighton’s favour, though, as the Hammers have one win, one draw and five defeats from seven away games in 2022.

Liverpool are the only Premier League team unbeaten at home this season while Bruno Lage’s side have lost eight of their past 13 league games, deflating the rich promise Wolves showed earlier in the campaign.

Mike Jackson’s side have a differential of 20 in their favour so their fate is very much in their own hands. Win and Burnley are in the top flight for another season. Unfortunately beating Newcastle is a huge task at present: leaving aside predictable losses to Manchester City and Liverpool, they have won their past five matches and the manner in which they easily dispatched an Arsenal side who desperately needed a win on Monday after those defeats is likely to make Burnley fans very nervous. The positive side for Jackson is that Leeds are facing equally tough opponents in Brentford.

Manchester City need only four more points to retain their title. They will be confident of moving closer towards their goal after their thrashing of Wolves. Kevin De Bruyne should be full of belief after scoring four goals at Molineux but West Ham will be determined to make life difficult for Pep Guardiola’s side. They still have a chance of snatching sixth place off Manchester United and will want to make Mark Noble’s final game before retirement one to remember.

"The big news in Birmingham is that Philippe Coutinho will be making the city his permanent home. After an inconsistent loan spell Aston Villa will hope the creative force can refind his magic touch next season after a summer in which he can bed in fully. Steven Gerrard’s side fought hard, arguably deserving a point, in defeat to Liverpool in midweek and will be hopeful they can still secure a top-half finish if they pick up where they left off, starting with Crystal Palace. Patrick Vieira will undoubtedly feel the same and the Frenchman has the fine wind of good form at his back. A third win in succession would give Palace a great shot at 10th or a smidge higher and would be their first time in the top 10 since 2014-15.

It was Vardy’s first 90 minutes in the league for Leicester since 28 December after hamstring and knee injuries ravaged this year for the striker. Lucky for him relegated Watford are the next team up and he will no doubt be eyeing up another tension-releasing onslaught in front of goal. Brendan Rodgers will surely be looking at long-term replacements for Vardy if the manager himself intends to stick around at the King Power for the long haul. Roy Hodgson’s side finally ended their 11-match losing streak at home against Everton but bettering that with a win feels unlikely considering their raft of players injured or struggling for match fitness.

"Norwich are not long for this world in the top flight but there are some morsels still to aim for with two games remaining. A single point will beat their tally of 21 when relegated in the 2019-20 season and bump them to seventh in the lowest totals in Premier League history, while another three would push them up to eighth, above Sheffield United’s 23 from last season. A rather large problem is their injury-ravaged squad: Norwich will be without seven first-team players, a welcome sight for a Wolves side drifting along and searching for a first win in six. Bruno Lage is surely looking to the summer to refresh his small squad but a much-needed victory would lift some jaded spirits.

Thomas Frank’s side are much improved since that FA Cup meeting in February, however, with Christian Eriksen helping to inspire a run of six wins in nine league games, while by Lampard’s admission Everton looked tired in their goalless draw at Watford in midweek.

It is not that they ever looked nailed on to survive but the manner of their past two ill-tempered, dismal defeats is potentially sounding their top-flight death knell. The squad is shattering with injuries and suspensions at a crucial time while Patrick Bamford remains a doubt to appear. One wonders how they might have fared with his goals and creativity splashed throughout the campaign. A win against in-form Brighton would be incredible for Jesse Marsch but a point would still lift them out of the bottom three if Burnley have lost at Tottenham earlier on Sunday.

But that is all the time the Arsenal manager has to sort out a team that barely got going on Thursday night before they were undone by defensive blunders and Spurs’ predatory strikers. The Gunners’ backline will be threadbare on Monday, with an injured Gabriel joining the suspended Rob Holding as the newest absentees.

The suddenness of the wounds West Ham sustained in Thursday’s Europa League semi-final are arguably harder to recover from, and they arrive at Carrow Road on a run of five matches without a win.

Pep Guardiola talked honestly on Friday regarding the pain felt by all at Manchester City following the torrid Champions League semi-final knockout by Real Madrid. But can his players show how hard-headed they are by accepting the continental dream is over for another season and that all that matters now is the 12 points left to compete for in the Premier League?

The stakes might not be high but this end-of-season encounter is not completely meaningless. Rather than challenging for the title or pushing for a Champions League spot Manchester United still need points to make sure of a Europa League place and avoid the Europa Conference. Brighton – ninth but only four points above Southampton in 15th – are seeking a highest top flight finish since they came 13th in the old First Division in 1982. To inch closer to their goals both must improve on recent form with Brighton having failed to win at home in their last eight and United losing their past four away matches in the Premier League. Cristiano Ronaldo also needs two goals to reach 700 in club football.

Antonio Conte believes it suits his side to go “face-to-face” with an attacking team while Jürgen Klopp considers this “the biggest challenge for protection we have faced for a long time” due to Tottenham’s counter-attacking quality. It may prove a decisive weekend for both clubs’ Premier League aspirations but form favours the title contenders. Liverpool have lost only one of their past 18 league games against Spurs and have scored more goals in this campaign – 139 – than any in the club’s illustrious history.

"Watford’s hopes of staying in the league hang by a thread as even if they win all of their remaining matches they could still go down. They do have some hope against Crystal Palace, though, as their away form has produced almost three-quarters of their points tally.

Granted, for Spurs to have a realistic chance they will need to beat Liverpool on Saturday so Chelsea should be fine, but the wheels could still fall off with the sale of the club still in limbo. Fortunately their chances of staying third until the season’s end are boosted by facing Wolves.

A top-half finish is still on the table, too, so they should both be gunning for victory still as they are only four points behind Brighton in ninth.

No one would have predicted them moving from four points adrift to sitting two points above Everton in 16th. Aston Villa now stand in their way to salvation in all likelihood as the fixture gods present a strange scenario where they face each other home and away in the next two weeks. Villa naturally beat Norwich last time out but with a first win in six matches so Burnley should not be too fazed by the challenge.

The only thing consistent about Tottenham this season has been their inconsistency. It is a little surprising they are still in contention for a top-four finish but those ambitions will wither unless they can string a run together between now and the end of the season. With a trip to Anfield next up and a potential showdown with Arsenal at home on the horizon anything less than victory against a Leicester side distracted by the return leg against Roma in the Europa Conference League on Thursday could prove terminal. Tottenham have failed to score in their last two outings so this could be the perfect opportunity for Harry Kane and Son Heung-min to prove they are the most fearsome duo in the Premier League.

West Ham are limping towards the climax of what still feels like a season to remember despite their dip. Their top-four hopes have evaporated and they need to overturn a 2-1 Europa League semi-final deficit at Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday. Fighting on two fronts has taken its toll with David Moyes already without three first choice centre-backs in the injured Issa Diop and Angelo Ogbonna and suspended Craig Dawson. In contrast Arsenal – who have no European distractions – have a spring in their step having grasped the initiative in the race for Champions League qualification and welcome back Takehiro Tomiyasu.

Having lost all seven away games under Lampard Everton, who could be five points adrift of Burnley come kick off, simply cannot afford to drop points in their three remaining home fixtures.

For all Manchester City’s attacking verve it is unlikely they will be able to repeat the emphatic nature of Liverpool’s victory over Leeds in March. Leeds are a far more organised side under Jesse Marsch than the one brushed aside 6-0 at Anfield in the penultimate game of Marcelo Bielsa’s reign. The fact Leeds are also still in a relegation battle – despite taking 11 points from their past five games – will also make the task tougher for Pep Guardiola’s side who could have one eye on Wednesday’s Champions League second leg at Real Madrid. City thumped Leeds 7-0 at the Etihad in December but Guardiola would bite your hand off for a scrappy 1-0 win at Elland Road.

If Liverpool are to stumble in their pursuit of Manchester City then it would not be completely surprising if it came at St James’ Park. Eddie Howe – with the help of a considerable amount of money – has transformed Newcastle from relegation fodder to the Premier League’s most upwardly mobile team. Four wins on the spin has lifted them to ninth and they are an even tougher proposition at home where they have won their past six. That is unlikely to prove too daunting for a Liverpool side boosted by the news of Jürgen Klopp’s contract extension and who have won 13 of their past 14 in the league – the only blip a 2-2 draw with City – while going unbeaten since 28 December.

Brighton’s quest for a best top-flight finish continues against Wolves. Graham Potter’s side are only a point above Southampton in 13th so will be hungry to return to winning ways. Yves Bissouma coming back from suspension to strengthen their spine makes this task a lot more palatable. Wolves will look at the table and think what might have been with a little more luck on their side this season but finishing sixth is still within reach.

A win for Burnley takes Watford to all but gone territory as they can draw level with the Clarets only if they win their four remaining games.

Southampton and Crystal Palace are winding down their respective seasons with a bit of a whimper as both teams are essentially safe from relegation. Ralph Hasenhüttl and Patrick Vieira will be assessing their squads for a summer shakeup as each have talent at their disposal and have impressed on occasion but are 13th and 14th respectively due to inconsistent performances. One of Vieira’s biggest headaches will be replacing the on-loan Conor Gallagher’s brilliance in midfield next term.

Despite picking up 10 points from their past four games Leeds are still very much in a relegation battle, which highlights the trouble Marcelo Bielsa left the club in. Palace still need one more win to reach the magical 40-point mark and cannot afford to let the hangover from their FA Cup semi-final defeat linger.

"The return of Christian Eriksen has been incredibly uplifting and the midfielder will be looking to add another chapter to the fairytale by denting the Champions League hopes of his former club. Eriksen has inspired Brentford to five wins in their past six games to end fears of an instant return to the Championship and Tottenham are unlikely to be given an easy ride as they bid to bounce back from a damaging defeat to Brighton in their last outing. The away fans will give Eriksen a warm reception but hope they will be cheering their own talisman, Harry Kane, come full time, with Brentford being the only one of 31 clubs he has faced in the Premier League that he has yet to score against.

Pep Guardiola says he loves this part of the season and for him and his Manchester City team the equation is simple: beat Watford and their remaining five opponents and they will have retained the championship for the second time under his management.

"Twenty years ago a clash between Arsenal and Manchester United at this stage of the season would have been framed as a title decider. Things have changed plenty since the heady reigns of Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger, however, and Saturday’s early kick-off is reduced to a scuffle to remain in contention for fourth spot. If United – who will be boosted by the return of Cristiano Ronaldo – fail to improve on a dismal run of two wins in seven games their hopes will be virtually over. The picture looks a lot brighter for Arsenal after their victory at Chelsea in midweek and a win for Mikel Arteta’s side would put the pressure firmly back on Tottenham.

Dean Smith’s side showed tremendous fight in defeat against Manchester United last time out but arguably Newcastle will pose a much more difficult proposition. They are a team in sync compared to one carried solely on Cristiano Ronaldo’s shoulders. A Norwich win would close the gap to six points from the last safe spot with five games to play, until Burnley attempt to jump out of danger against Wolves on Sunday.

West Ham may be coming off the back of an impressive Europa League win against Lyon but they have been inconsistent in the league recently, alternating between wins and losses for their past six games.

Fortunately they face a Saints side without a win in five matches so if Arsenal show up and play with an ounce of positivity then Ralph Hasenhüttl’s usual forward-thinking approach should allow for plenty of chances.

"So, which Spurs team will turn up? The Manchester City-bothering one, all controlled power and counterattacking, with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min in perfect harmony, or the one that lost 1-0 at Burnley and was then outplayed and lost by the same score at Middlesbrough in the FA Cup? No one knows, of course, least of all Antonio Conte, it seems. Meanwhile, Frank Lampard has guided Everton to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup but knows he cannot be distracted with them only one point above the relegation zone. As a Chelsea player, Lampard knew almost continuous success against Spurs and he will hope he can bring some of that mojo to his struggling side. However, upcoming home games against Wolves and Newcastle may bring more reward.

Three wins in a row for Mikel Arteta’s side have improved the mood at the Emirates no end after what was a scratchy start to the year. For Roy Hodgson, the euphoria of a point at Old Trafford last week is tempered by only one win this year.

"Despite Marcelo Bielsa’s high status at Elland Road it was inevitable he would be shown the door following a calamitous run of results that dragged Leeds into a relegation battle. Jesse Marsch has little time to ease himself in due to their precarious position with his first task being to fix a defence that shipped 20 goals in five games during February – a Premier League record. The continued absence of Kalvin Phillips and most probably Patrick Bamford adds to his problems although that will cut little ice with Leicester who are still without the defenders Jonny Evans, Timothy Castagne, Wesley Fofana and Ryan Bertrand.

November’s 3-2 win prevented Jürgen Klopp’s side from setting a club record of 26 games unbeaten in all competitions and exposed a set-piece frailty that has rarely been seen since.

With all the turmoil surrounding Roman Abramovich’s sale of Chelsea, one could argue there is no better time to try to catch them off guard. Luton almost did on Wednesday in the Cup but it is fairly likely that Thomas Tuchel’s team talk at half-time reminded Chelsea of their status.

Christian Eriksen’s return will rightly take centre stage at Brentford Community Stadium. Anything he can produce in his minutes on the pitch would be a bonus. This has the feel of a classic six-pointer and the Bees will be in what had once seemed an unlikely battle against the drop if Newcastle take the points.

With their 15-game unbeaten run in the Premier League halted last weekend and Liverpool reducing a 12-point gap to three, while establishing a superior goal difference in the process, Manchester City suddenly find themselves under pressure at the top. Another winning streak may be required to keep the challengers at bay.

While Antonio Conte’s Tottenham have lost four of their past five League games, most recently at Burnley in midweek, Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds are on the brink of a relegation battle. Their 6-0 thrashing at Liverpool in midweek emphasised the team’s defensive vulnerabilities but few expect Bielsa to modify his attacking philosophy against Harry Kane and company.

What a difference a week makes. Burnley have gone from the darkest depths of the table to three points from safety in the space of two brilliant performances. Sean Dyche’s side seemed to have forgotten themselves but Wout Weghorst’s destruction of Brighton and a masterful 1-0 over an over-confident Tottenham has them back grinding for survival. A third successive win (last seen in April 2019) could incredibly move them out of danger. So can Crystal Palace survive an encounter with this reconfigured behemoth? Patrick Vieira’s only recent successes have come when punching down and after putting four past Watford the Frenchman will hope he has found an attacking combination that truly clicks after Palace’s early fire appeared extinguished.

Both sides are potentially staring a third successive defeat in the face while neither have scored in their two defeats. Brighton have one win from their past six and Villa one from seven so the early purple patch for Steve Gerrard is well and truly over. The key Brighton defender Adam Webster missing out may give Villa the edge, though, and confidence may be at its lowest for Graham Potter’s side.

Manchester United have changed managers since then but Fernandes, the scorer of a hat-trick in that dissection of Bielsa’s defence, remains and is likely to operate as the advanced playmaker in a 4-2-3-1 visiting formation. With Kalvin Phillips still sidelined by injury Koch is likely to anchor the Leeds midfield, with his principle task being to stop Fernandes. Given that the visitors are desperate to secure a Champions League place and Bielsa knows his side are too close to the relegation zone for comfort, much is at stake.

The fortunate 1-0 win over Aston Villa in the FA Cup on Monday was the latest example of how disjointed the team are but also meant United have lost once in 10 games under their interim manager.

To claim any points Wolves will have to be far more clinical than they have been in a season when they have created – and wasted – plenty of chances.

Indeed if Newcastle fail to secure their first win of the season then relegation will start to look increasingly inevitable. Unfortunately Howe’s record against Sean Dyche’s team does not inspire great confidence. Newcastle’s manager can only hope for another stellar performance from Joelinton. Apparently reborn under his management, the £40m Brazilian striker excelled in an often defensive midfield role after Ciaran Clark’s early sending-off during Tuesday’s draw with Norwich and he may well end up being reinvented as a No 8.

Brighton, however, are sliding slowly down the table after their impressive start. No wins in nine matches tells its own story, although Neal Maupay’s excellent goal on Wednesday to earn a point at West Ham may put a bounce in their step, especially as it ended Brighton’s collective goalscoring drought of 335 minutes.

Leicester, by contrast, have been rather fragile recently and were booed off after last week’s defeat by Chelsea, but Thursday’s encouraging win in the Europa League may have restored some belief.

Both Jürgen Klopp and Ralph Hasenhüttl benefited from the work of top influencer Ralf Rangnick – although the late Wolfgang Frank was the Liverpool manager’s biggest inspiration – but bring contrasting form into their meeting at Anfield. The Southampton manager will be seeking improvement in front of goal following a wasteful defeat at Norwich. Klopp has no such worries. His Liverpool team have scored at least twice in each of their past 16 matches – the first English team to achieve that feat since Wolves in 1939 – and need two more to record 700 goals in the Klopp era.

Their aggressive personalities on the pitch are at odds with their calmer demeanours now but their desire to succeed has not diminished. Gerrard is four years Vieira’s junior but arguably has the edge in managerial experience – certainly in trophies. It is of course all about what their players can do for them now but there may be times on Saturday afternoon – or maybe the whole game – when those of a certain age wish Gerrard and Vieira were still doing battle on the pitch.

Everton will hope City fail to overcome the significant absences but, after five games without a win, they still are likely to struggle as Rafael Benítez continues to miss talisman Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

United’s form may be suspect – together with their defence and midfield – but they did sweep aside Tottenham in their last away game and a Watford side that have failed to score in four of their past five games would appear even less of a threat than Spurs were during the dying embers of Nuno Espírito Santo’s ill-fated reign.

Shortly afterwards Joelinton arrived on Tyneside for £40m and it will be intriguing in due course to see if Howe can unlock the Brazilian’s talent.

Before eyes get too wide as to how far Palace can rise, they must get past a serious acid test in Sean Dyche’s side.

Ralph Hasenhüttl will be acutely aware, however, that Norwich still look seriously undermanned on paper and that his side are fit, firing and fresh from the international break. Three wins from four is a serious upturn in fortunes and the Saints have a fully fit squad aside from Jack Stephens.

This season, however, the clubs’ paths have diverged, with Chelsea on top of the pile and aiming for a six-point lead over Manchester City, for a little while at least, if they win this early kick-off. Leicester might seem marooned in 12th, but a win could take them above Manchester United and into sixth after everything shakes out.

Potter’s problem is his winning start stalling.

Watford were as abysmal as Liverpool were formidable last week but, having had an extra week to work with a team that has won once in seven games, the Italian will expect a response against an injury-hit Everton.

A scrappy 1-0 victory over Watford in their last outing did at least lift them out of the relegation zone and the visit of winless Southampton provides another opportunity to regain some swagger, especially as Ralph Hasenhüttl’s beleaguered side will be without the suspended James Ward-Prowse.

Recent personal reasons for missing games aside, one-time bright spark Todd Cantwell’s last goal in the Premier League was 21 games ago on 1 January 2020. And while Norwich are predictably struggling, Brighton have confounded expectations, appearing to be this season’s surprise package. Graham Potter will expect a positive result and deservedly so as his side have taken seven points from three matches on the road so far.

Claudio Ranieri begins his mission to keep Watford up with the awkward task of keeping Liverpool at bay. Mohamed Salah is in scintillating form as he aims to score in an eighth successive league game for the first time while Sadio Mané has extra incentive as he chases his 100th Premier League goal. The likelihood of a shutout from Watford looks even more unlikely when their last in the top flight came a distant 17 games ago. But it was against Jürgen Klopp’s side in a rather exciting 3-0 win that ended Liverpool’s record 44-game unbeaten streak in February 2020. Ranieri needs to be aggressive and attempt to exploit Alisson and Fabinho missing out but getting into a shootout with Liverpool is often asking for trouble.

Even if the Gunners, buoyed by three consecutive league victories, win on Saturday evening they cannot overtake Graham Potter’s team, testament to Brighton’s good start to the season.

Interestingly, Jürgen Klopp has poured scorn on Gareth Southgate’s decision to deploy the right-back in that department for England against Andorra.

Arsenal fans have been somewhat divided over the strength of the side Mikel Arteta put out in the Carabao Cup second round this week. Some are glad he took it seriously enough to still be in the tournament; others wondering how has it come to this in a cup Arsène Wenger used to give talented youngsters first-team exposure. Either way the 6-0 shellacking of West Brom has at least put a little swagger into Arsenal’s stride as they travel to take on the champions without a league goal or point on the board.

Manchester United have enjoyed kicking Leeds around at home since the latter’s promotion so Southampton could be a better test of where Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side are at. The last time United won by more than a goal at St Mary’s was 2009. Jadon Sancho starting would also give an even better indication of the kind of damage United can inflict going forward if Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes continue their destructive form from last week.

Thomas Tuchel was only in charge for the last of those three defeats but will know that an Emirates Stadium full for a league game for the first time in 17 months and the hosts having Bukayo Saka and captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang available again could present a genuine early test of Chelsea’s title credentials, against a Chelsea side without Christian Pulisic, who has tested positive.

Much here hinges on how Newcastle’s first large crowd – almost 50,000 are expected – since late February 2020 react to Bruce.

Still, Daniel Farke’s side will feel under less pressure to make an immediate impact and Liverpool’s midfield remains a relatively unknown quantity since Georginio Wijnaldum’s departure. The Kosovan international Milot Rashica is an exciting home addition and could give the Reds something to think about at left-back in the absence of Andy Robertson.

But, after collecting 23 points from the last 27 available, his team will be in the Champions League next season with three more against an opponent they beat 7-0 five months ago.

"Aston Villa could have a problem in defence with Matty Cash ruled out and Tyrone Mings doubtful but they will have top scorer Ollie Watkins back from suspension. Villa struggled in front of goal in the 0-0 draw with Everton on Thursday so the return of Watkins, who was serving a one-match ban after his sending off against Leeds, will be a welcome one for Dean Smith. Palace could make changes to the side that lost 3-1 to Southampton on Tuesday but Christian Benteke, who has found goalscoring form towards the end of the campaign, is expected to retain his place in attack. A large proportion of Roy Hodgson’s squad are out of contract in the summer and, with Premier League safety secured, they have an opportunity to impress potential new employers.

His team have the worst home record of the top 14 clubs in the Premier League and, as another sterile display on Thursday at Aston Villa underlined, their lack of creativity without James Rodríguez is glaring.

"While Jürgen Klopp started the season with far grander ambitions than scrapping for fourth place come May, the Liverpool manager will sense that a tortuous campaign can maybe end on a happy note after Thursday’s victory at Old Trafford reignited their top-four challenge. Given third- and fourth-placed Leicester and Chelsea meet on Tuesday, Klopp knows that three wins will probably be enough for his side to leapfrog one of them come the final Sunday and secure Champions League football. Given his side’s form this season that cannot be considered a foregone conclusion, yet there were signs in the 4-2 win over United of the departing champions being a potent attacking force again. West Brom, relegated by last Sunday’s defeat at Arsenal, have nothing but pride to play for but Sam Allardyce rarely turns down the opportunity to bloody the nose of one of the bigger clubs.

"If you speak to any Tottenham fans, this is a time of much debate. Who will the next manager be? Will Harry Kane stay? And, most urgently: is there any way Spurs can manage to not finish seventh and therefore qualify for Uefa’s new Europa Conference League? The simple solution to that last question is to keep playing as badly as they did at Leeds last weekend and Everton, West Ham or (God forbid) even Arsenal could yet claim that dubious privilege. The answer to the first question is the most pressing, and may also provide the solution to Kane’s future. The man in the opposite dugout on Sunday, Wolves’ Nuno Espírito Santo, has been mentioned as a potential candidate. Then again, there have been already been a few of those. Ryan Mason is recovering from the considerable shock of being handed a Wembley cup final against the champions-elect as his first ever game in charge of a football team, but is clearly holding the fort until the summer. Just don’t finish seventh, Ryan, and you may even end up with the permanent gig.

"Southampton may have had a wretched second half of the season – Tuesday’s win over Crystal Palace was only their third in 18 Premier League games – but they do have one thing Fulham would dearly like: another season in the top flight. Having won just three of their last 25 games and five in total Scott Parker and his side cannot really complain, but there are many neutrals who will be sad to see them go given their enterprising attacking game. Premier League scouts will be circling around the likes of André-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Tosin Adarabioyo but given the volume of players on loan Parker will want to hang on to his leading lights if he is to fashion an instant return. Danny Ings was on target in that midweek win and while the striker may not be a Southampton player for much longer, on Saturday he will again likely exhibit the kind of lethal finishing that Fulham, for all their good intent, could not muster this season.

Last week’s defeat to Everton was perhaps a fatal blow to their top-four hopes, but a Europa League or Europa Conference place is still very much in their grasp if they can win their final three games.

It is fair to say Turf Moor’s ‘ginger Mourinho’ has a rather different philosophy to the man in the opposite dugout on Saturday, Marcelo Bielsa, but there will certainly be mutual respect between the pair whose sides both play to their strengths and are united by a fierce work ethic. The way Leeds dismantled Tottenham at Elland Road last weekend showed that Bielsa’s hard-running style has, despite some doubts, lasted until May. A European place looks beyond Leeds, but a top-half finish will be just reward for their fine season.

Arsenal’s season may be alive in the Europa League but they share an empty feeling with Sheffield United that their league campaign has become more of a box-ticking exercise at this point. Mikel Arteta’s side must fight through the disappointment to avoid going five games without victory in all competitions before the second leg against Slavia Prague. United will hope to recreate last season’s brilliant win over Arsenal. It was surprising then but would be much less so now regardless of their league position.

Everton need to regain their winning touch as time dwindles away for them to make a late surge to qualify for European competition next season. The Champions League remains in play but if they fail to beat Brighton and turn around a poor run of three without victory that glittering door could finally start to feel closed. Carlo Ancelotti’s side certainly don’t appear to be the same one that started the season so emphatically. Graham Potter will be hoping Brighton can compound Everton’s misery and take a step toward confirming their place in the Premier League for another season.

A mild irritation for the manager compared with the soul-shattering migraine José Mourinho is nursing.

But playing well usually makes it easier to finish higher up the table.” Roy Hodgson is less philosophical but Crystal Palace’s counter-attacking strategy is serving them well and, even with the injured Wilfried Zaha absent, his side – and Eberechi Eze especially – threaten to fully stretch Bielsa’s sometimes vulnerable defence.

"Mikel Arteta saw Arsenal’s seven-game unbeaten league run end in disastrous fashion at Molineux on Tuesday but would do well to remember just how bleak things were looking for him six weeks ago when a dreadful run of form precipitated talk of his removal. The result that started it was delivered by Aston Villa, a chastening 3-0 loss at the Emirates in early November when all the attacking vibrancy Dean Smith’s side have exhibited this season was on display in the form of young English talent such as Ollie Watkins, Ross Barkley and Jack Grealish. Arteta’s homegrown English youngsters Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka have helped dig Arsenal out of that hole and they can climb above Villa with victory on Saturday, although will have to do so without the suspended pair of David Luiz and hitherto ever-present goalkeeper Bernd Leno.

Fulham are winless in their past 12 matches and that run feels likely to continue against a West Ham side pushing for European qualification. Jesse Lingard’s arrival provided instant success as David Moyes’ knocked off Aston Villa with ease thanks to two goals from the Manchester United loanee.

At a time when he remains under intense pressure from Newcastle supporters who would like nothing better than to see him replaced by his still-adored predecessor, Rafael Benítez, Bruce could do with avoiding a similar new year mauling at the hands of Brendan Rodgers’s high flyers. The home manager can only hope Callum Wilson will eclipse Leicester’s Jamie Vardy in the attacking department, while his side’s new abandonment of their hallmark “low block” and new tactic of pressing higher up the pitch – which produced a point when Liverpool visited Tyneside last Wednesday – will pay dividends.

Sam Allardyce’s first three games have seen a highly creditable point at Liverpool sandwiched by home humiliations at the hands of Aston Villa and Leeds.

Spurs could make a serious title statement with following up a win against Manchester City with another success at Stamford Bridge. Lampard’s side meanwhile can leapfrog Mourinho if they hold firm at home.

Well Lallana certainly knows Jürgen Klopp’s side well and will be hungry to show he was let go a touch too soon considering Liverpool’s mountain of injury problems.

Aston Villa will beat Brighton easily if they play as they did when embarrassing Arsenal at the Emirates before the break. Life has been a little tougher at Villa Park though – Liverpool demolition aside – and Dean Smith is likely to have warned his team against overconfidence. Graham Potter’s side have flashed in attack in spots this season but have struggled for creativity recently with three goals in their past four matches. The logic behind counting on a proven poor finisher in Danny Welbeck and an ageing Adam Lallana should be questioned. On the flip side Lewis Dunk’s return strengthens an already stout defence that could limit Villa’s relative potency. Potter has had enough to time to plot a much-needed win but does he have the talent to execute? Possibly not.

Motivation may be totally irrelevant, though, as Arsenal seem to have skewed too heavily toward preventing goals.

Nuno Espírito Santo is trying to turn Wolves into a more dominant side this season and, despite injury concerns, this looks like a good opportunity to start.

"One of Arsenal’s repeated failures last season was in neglecting to put away supposedly inferior opponents once their noses were in front. Sheffield United’s last visit to the Emirates, in January, was a case in point; John Fleck scored a just-about-deserved leveller and the hosts’ problems loomed large. They look better now but Mikel Arteta believes Sunday’s opponents have “deserved much more” than three straight defeats.

"Marcelo Bielsa says he is not Pep Guardiola’s lodestar as the pair meet for the first time in the Premier League. “I do not feel like a mentor to Guardiola. It’s not just how I feel, it has been evidenced to not being the case,” said the ever pedantic Leeds manager who must trust Patrick Bamford to maintain his one goal per game Premier League scoring record. “If there’s a manager who is independent in his own ideas, that is Guardiola. It’s not just because I say it is, it’s because his teams play like no other team.” Guardiola has repeatedly described Bielsa as the best coach in the world after their friendship was cemented in 2006 when the Spaniard travelled to meet the former Argentina coach on his ranch near Rosario.

Everton have started wonderfully but injuries have hit Carlo Ancelotti’s side already. Midfielders Allan and André Gomes definitely miss out while Richarlison is doubtful. Carlo Ancelotti would love to grab a fourth win from four to keep his side’s 100% record and regroup following the international break. That may not be much of a worry though if Dominic Calvert-Lewin continues his incredible run of form. Brighton were desperately unlucky not to beat Manchester United let alone draw.

Brighton are still winless this year and under pressure as they gear up to face bitter rivals Crystal Palace. Roy Hodgson’s side were in the same boat until last weekend. The confidence three points can bring could give Palace a useful edge with Brighton looking over their shoulder into the relegation zone. One certainty is Graham Potter needs to plan for Wilfired Zaha. The forward tends to save his best for this “derby”. Avoiding defeat could be the order of the day again for both sides.

Only another win for Liverpool feels likely especially after losing narrowly in Spain on Tuesday. The defeat against Atlético Madrid will have stung a little and Jürgen Klopp will be keen for his side to salve the wound. David Moyes’s side are winless in seven in all competitions but their fixture run looks challenging. Next up are Southampton, Arsenal, Wolves, Tottenham annd Chelsea.

Wolves will be in bright spirits after demolishing Espanyol and spurred on by the chance to end their winless league run against struggling Norwich. Goals finally came for Nuno Espírito Santo and they will likely flow once more against a side who concede close to two a game on average. To stop Wolves Daniel Farke will hope the winter break has refreshed tired legs and minds. Norwich are eight points from safety and are running out of time. Teemu Pukki being given better service to score from open play would be a huge help as two penalties are all he has to his name in 2020.

Manchester City’s European ban is overshadowing their football but they returned to the pitch after Uefa’s action and dominated West Ham. Pep Guardiola will be looking for City to be even better as they gear up to face Real Madrid in the Champions League.

Panic is not yet required though as injuries have ravaged the squad and draws against Arsenal and Manchester City show Roy Hodgson’s side are mentally present. Relegation seems an unlikely prospect as it does for Newcastle, who are a point ahead in 13th.

The club denied the four inhaled nitrous oxide – aka laughing gas. “It was probably not the best decision in the world,” said an unamused Potter, whose team hover three points above the relegation zone. “Occasionally they do things that aren’t so clever.” Sheffield United trust their Dubai break will help secure European qualification.

This meeting begins a 13-game run-in during which Chelsea and Manchester United each hope to claim a Champions League berth. For Frank Lampard’s side the carrot is knowing a win takes them nine points clear of their visitors who for the same reason will be desperate to avoid this and claim victory themselves to close to within three points to the hosts.

"When Arsenal won 1-0 at St James’ Park on the opening day of the season the suggestion the two sides would have the same number of points after 25 games would have got you strange looks in Newcastle and north London alike. And yet through the departure of Unai Emery, the brief interim tenure of Freddie Ljungberg and now the arrival of Mikel Arteta, the Gunners have won just five more times in the league to languish in 10th, ahead of Steve Bruce’s surprisingly resilient side only on goal difference. Arteta has drawn five of his seven league games in charge and Arsenal have drawn 13 from 25 in total: after the extravagance of a winter break in Dubai you get the feeling the Emirates crowd will accept nothing less than all three points on Sunday.

Tottenham have a formidable record at Villa Park – they have not been beaten on their last nine visits and they have won their last five away trips at Villa with a combined scored of 14-1. How they would love for that trend to continue on Sunday. Back-to-back wins have reignited Tottenham’s hopes of a top-four finish but Villa are on the right side of the dotted line – just – and have developed a habit for unexpected wins at just the right time.

"Norwich are bottom and seven points from safety with the joint leakiest defence in the top flight so this may not be the ideal time for them to face Liverpool – Jürgen Klopp’s side have scored 28 goals against Norwich in their past seven Premier League encounters, including a 4-1 victory at Anfield on the opening day of the season. Daniel Farke will need Teemu Pukki to rediscover some form if the home side are to inflict Liverpool’s first league defeat since January 2019 as the Finnish striker has scored only twice in his past seven appearances after starting the season with five goals in three games. Liverpool, already overwhelming favourites to take all three points, should be boosted by the return from injury of Sadio Mané and James Milner.

James Ward-Prowse is in contention after suffering a cut to his knee in the FA Cup defeat to Tottenham, while Matt Lowton and Charlie Taylor face late fitness tests for Burnley. Ashley Barnes, who scored twice in the August game at Turf Moor, remains sidelined with a groin problem. Burnley are something of a bogey side for Southampton; the Saints are winless in their last six Premier League meetings, scoring only two goals.

Watford need to break their recent crippling habit of throwing away leads. Nigel Pearson’s side have nothing to show from their last two league games despite leading in both and sit in the relegation zone when they could have been five points clear. Brighton also need to snap a dangerous winless streak stretching five matches and back to December. The resurgence of Glenn Murray could give them the required boost as goals have not been flowing freely.

Richarlison is likely to return for Everton to face his former club Watford after missing two matches. Nigel Pearson has Will Hughes and Danny Welbeck back at his disposal and both could be useful options after a damaging late defeat against Aston Villa.

It is over a year since Jürgen Klopp’s team last failed to win at Anfield in the league and over two years since they lost to a team outside of the so-called ‘big six’.

Sheffield United have strengthened in the transfer window and club record signing Sander Berge may feature in midfield but most likely from the bench. Crystal Palace’s addition Cenk Tosun is missing with injury but Roy Hodgson welcomes back Andros Townsend and Christian Benteke from injury to cover the Turkish striker. Chris Wilder’s first win in the top flight was against Palace and the Blades can return to fifth place with another set of three points if results go their way.

Bournemouth and Aston Villa need a win as crunch time is approaching in the relegation battle. Eddie Howe’s side could climb out of danger with three points while dropping their rivals into trouble and a dip in form may be on the cards for Villa after the thrill of making the League Cup final.

"Football fans are naturally superstitious but funny things can happen when your team is on a long unbeaten run. Arsenal supporters will remember the “this is the day we are going to lose” mentality in the latter stages of the record 49-game streak in 2003-04. It could be a tricky looking away game, or perhaps an early kick-off, but usually it would just be against a bitter rival who you knew would enjoy ending your run more than anybody else. So it is entirely natural that Liverpool – unbeaten this season, unbeaten in 38 league matches and unbeaten in the league at Anfield since April 2017 – seem to be entertaining the fact they will lose to Manchester United on Sunday. True, United are the only team to take a point off Jürgen Klopp’s side this season courtesy of October’s 1-1 draw at Old Trafford but their inconsistent away form has seen them lose at Watford and Arsenal of late and there is little to suggest they can silence Anfield.

Aston Villa need to move on quickly from the 6-1 home thrashing by Manchester City and focus on how to get the better of their relegation rivals Brighton. Dean Smith’s side have a respectable 14 points from eight games against teams in the bottom seven so panic must not set in despite residing in the danger zone. A huge boost is Pepe Reina’s arrival between the sticks. His 285 appearances in the Premier League for Liverpool will provide guidance for the second-worst defence in the league – one goal shy of conceding two goals per game.

Aston Villa are struggling with injuries and will need to be just as disciplined as they were against Leicester to gain anything positive.

This time the game is not at Anfield, Liverpool have the small matter of a 13-point lead and 18 games still to play but, well, there’s the narrative and Mourinho will not be shy of running with it. Despite his depleted Tottenham squad the Portuguese will indeed be desperate to inflict a first defeat of the season on Jürgen Klopp’s seemingly unstoppable side, as will his players who – lest we forget – lost a Champions League final to Liverpool fewer than eight months ago and were only beaten in the reverse fixture at Anfield in October by a controversial late penalty.

Everton’s revival has slowed after a narrow defeat to Manchester City on New Year’s Day and an infuriating FA Cup defeat to Liverpool’s kids but they have a chance to kick things back into gear against Brighton. Alireza Jahanbakhsh will be pushing to start for Graham Potter’s side after finally finding form but Aaron Mooy may miss out with a knock.

Southampton lost their opening two matches but tend to be tricky opposition for Brighton and will surely fancy their chances after Graham Potter’s attacking revolution stalled against West Ham.

Brighton are tanking and Wolves will hope they remain on their steep downward trajectory in order to bounce back from a poor defeat against Southampton. Five successive defeats for Brighton without scoring a goal is depressing and Chris Hughton’s side are fortunate to be sitting above Cardiff. The two-point advantage could evaporate quickly if Brighton fail again to show any sign of life. Wolves have been poor against sides in the bottom half but have a fully fit squad and the incentive of European football next season.

Watford will have mixed feelings about their defeat to Arsenal on Monday. They were the better sided despite being reduced to 10 men but lost owing to Ben Foster’s clanger. A chance to move swiftly on is provided by the trip to Huddersfield and a similar display will surely produce victory.

There are two different managers in the dugouts and probably 20 different players in the starting lineups (Mohamed Salah is one of only two survivors and was in the Chelsea ranks that day). More relevant is Liverpool’s failure to beat Chelsea in the last eight encounters at Anfield and their opponents’ problems on the road, with Maurizio Sarri’s side losing four of their last six away league games.

Manager and players alike have said their approach will not change and they cannot afford to falter against a Burnley team who, since beating Tottenham, have lost their last two games.

Among other things, the Watford captain said that the players would prefer it if their fans did not boo the Everton manager and “let us kick the shit out of them”, but Silva is under enough pressure as it is from pockets of his own support after a run of four losses in five and a season-long deluge of concessions from set plays. “I’m ready for everything and my job is to get my players ready for everything,” he said.

Wolves have lost five of their last seven matches at home and will want to avoid a third defeat to Leicester this season. Claude Puel is under pressure despite Leicester sitting comfortably in eighth and the chance to earn a third successive away win at the Molineux. Disappointing defeats to Newport County and Cardiff are the source of unrest and Puel’s reliance on Jamie Vardy is a problem. Leicester have won three of the 11 matches Vardy has played in but failed to score. Stopping him is key.

Watford and Burnley are unbeaten since Boxing Day. Sean Dyche seems to have stumbled across a purple patch thanks largely due installing Tom Heaton back in goal. Heaton has conceded two goals in four successive Burnley wins since Joe Hart conceded five to Everton. Goals still come at a premium for Dyche though as illustrated by miraculously beating Fulham 2-1 without a single shot on target. Watford will miss Will Hughes through concussion but Troy Deeney has hit form with four goals in six matches.

Southampton will be downbeat after losing to an injury ravaged West Ham and Ralph Hasenhüttl’s gloss could be further stripped away by Manchester City.

We’ve worked on the training ground, we’ve looked at analysis, we’ve looked at shape changes. You have to keep monitoring the situation.” At least Johann Berg Gudmundsson is fit for Burnley, while West Ham are hoping Pablo Zabaleta can recover from illness in time for Sunday’s trip.

Wolves arrested a poor run by stifling Arsenal last time out and will be confident they can move back into the top half with a victory against Huddersfield. David Wagner’s side had their own slice of good fortune before the break by moving off the foot of the table but with only six goals from 12 matches that may not last much longer.

Everton will have to be wary as they seek to finish of a month of improved results with three points and contemplate December, which includes trips to Liverpool and Manchester City as well as a visit from Spurs.

Watford returned to winnings ways unexpectedly against Wolves but are certainly the favourites against Huddersfield at home. David Wagner’s side need to conjure something from nothing to avoid extending their winless run – dating back to last season – to 14 matches. Goals are in incredibly short supply.

This means a return for club captain Tom Cairney, an undoubted confidence boost, even though he is likely to be on the bench.

Just one defeat from 10 matches in all competitions is testament to how well Nuno Espírito Santo is doing. He could name the same team for the ninth successive league game and, with Watford struggling, he should. After the away side’s hot start they have lost three of their past four and only scored two goals. A win could put Wolves level with Arsenal and Spurs if they both lose.

Southampton are without a home win this season and that seems unlikely to change against unbeaten Chelsea, who have lost this fixture just once since Southampton left the Dell.

"Chelsea’s record is still pristine while Cardiff have yet to win on their Premier League return, but the prospect of their visit to Stamford Bridge has already set Maurizio Sarri on edge. The Italian has been working with a skeleton squad over the past two weeks, and his time at Napoli exposed him to unpredictable results in the first game after international breaks. “Mentally, the match after the break is always very difficult,” he said. “And ‘materially’ because we will play against a very physical team in Cardiff.” The Welsh club have not won in this corner of south-west London since 1981, though Neil Warnock will relish ruffling feathers.

Shortly afterwards came the news that Wenger was stepping down and now his sucessor, Unai Emery, must trust that Mesut Özil and company can find a way to unpick the tight tactical locks Benítez routinely installs against this calibre of opposition.

Consistency has been key to this season’s surprise package, with Javi Gracia selecting the same lineup in every match so far.

Fulham are the first of the promoted sides to visit an Etihad Stadium that has proved a graveyard for so many during Pep Guardiola’s time in charge.

Neil Warnock will not be disheartened by two points from three matches though and Emery’s defence have yet to keep a clean sheet.

Something has to give. Watford and Tottenham each enter with 100% winning records. Javi Gracia’s three wins are the more surprising but victory at Old Trafford for Spurs is also a rarity.

The hosts are more cohesive as a unit these days and will offer a sterner test, though recent defeats to Liverpool and Watford have checked the optimism generated through pre-season.

"This is actually a managerial reunion of sorts. Rewind four years and Eddie Howe had paid a visit to Maurizio Sarri at Empoli, intrigued to discover more about the Italian’s coaching techniques. That stint was reciprocated on the south coast last year as Napoli played a friendly at the Vitality Stadium. They have stayed in touch ever since. “He is a very interesting young coach who will make a mark in the English football in the future,” said Sarri of his opposite number. “Bournemouth are very dangerous opponents for us.” Chelsea should need no reminding of that having lost 3-0 to them at Stamford Bridge in January.

David Wagner bemoaned a lack of quality in the final third as Huddersfield’s winless start to the season extended to the Carabao Cup at Stoke City in midweek.

The head-to-head between Brighton and Fulham in the Championship makes for excellent reading for the home support. Since Chris Hughton took over his side have won four out of four meetings. Slavisa Jokanovic will hope his side continue their form from the 4-2 win against Burnley to address the imbalance. Hughton’s defence have to neutralise the brute force of Aleksandr Mitrovic.

He is certainly in confident mood. “We’re raring to go, we fancy ourselves,” he said. “These games tend to bring out the best in us.” Rafael Benítez is without his Chelsea loanee Kenedy, whose penalty miss at Cardiff last week left Newcastle still seeking their first win of the season.

Javi Gracia is likely to stick with the side who have delivered five goals in two games, with Nathaniel Chalobah and Gerard Deulofeu not ready for Sunday’s home match. Roy Hodgson may make changes with new signings Max Meyer, Cheikhou Kouyaté, Jordan Ayew and goalkeeper Vicente Guaita in contention. The Palace manager has also heightened tensions in unusual fashion – accusing the Watford mascot Harry the Hornet of “disgraceful” provocation of Wilfried Zaha in the clubs’ December 2016 meeting.

Burnley are unlikely to arrive at Craven Cottage in perfect condition. A disappointing defeat to Olympiakos in Athens could make legs feel wearier and Fulham will certainly be hoping so as they search for a first win. Sean Dyche is unlikely to admit it but an end in sight to Thursday nights in obscure European locations could give his side a boost.

Puel has prevailed in the past two games between the sides at St Mary’s, winning 4-1 with Leicester last December and 3-0 as the home manager in January 2017.

Brighton arrive on a high following their impressive victory over Manchester United but stopping Liverpool is a far more complex assignment. The hosts have scored 18 goals without reply in their past six league games at Anfield – a run that includes a 4-0 defeat of Brighton on the final day of last season – and six goals in two games is their most prolific start since 1994-95. Brighton won twice on the road last season and their only league win at Anfield was in 1982.

Unai Emery’s season begins now. Arsenal showed signs they are beginning to adapt to his attacking style against Chelsea but defensive demons will take longer to cleanse. One positive has been Mattéo Guendouzi’s impressive jump from Ligue 2 to the Premier League. The 19-year-old has the highest total combined interceptions and tackles of any player so far. With his growing presence Arsenal now have a first chance to stamp their authority against a West Ham side that have also lost both of their opening fixtures. Manuel Pellegrini should handover team talk duties to Jack Wilshere for this one. After being cut loose from the Emirates this summer his passion for revenge could be all the motivation his mercurial teammates need.

Given the blow of losing Kevin De Bruyne for three months owing to a knee injury Pep Guardiola will want Manchester City to respond to Huddersfield as they did when travelling to Chelsea last September. Then Sergio Agüero was unavailable after a car accident and Benjamin Mendy because of a knee problem. City beat Chelsea 1-0 and would not lose for over two months.

The odds, however, remain very much in the favour of José Mourinho’s side and they should have Romelu Lukaku available after his World Cup exertions and Jesse Lingard is in the squad. Brighton will be without their captain Bruno, who injured a hamstring during the defeat at Watford, and are expected to make several changes. “If we look at our starting lineup last weekend we had one new player starting; others will be introduced over a period of time,” Chris Hughton said.

Cardiff and Newcastle will be looking to bounce back from opening defeats but neither will have been distraught by their performances. Rafael Benítez’s side have won their past 10 successive league matches against Cardiff so the omens are not brilliant for the home side.

Three points to see out a memorable season would be nice, but Burnley already have a hugely impressive 54 and have put themselves into Europe for the first time since 1967.

If City win they will set more records, however, for the most away wins in a Premier League season with 16, and the most points on the road, 50. “In the last few weeks these numbers have helped us keep focus,” said Guardiola, whose players secured the title on 15 April.

Last week’s win against Bournemouth was only their second in 10 league games but it gave the fans hope and Mark Hughes will be looking to capitalise on that during the trip to Goodison, where the atmosphere has been eerily quiet of late. Sam Allardyce, like Hughes another merry-go-round perennial to take over in the dugout since Saints defeated Everton 4-1 in October’s reverse fixture, reckons he has won “the hearts and minds” of the Everton majority with their home performances and insists the dissenters are a vocal minority. Some were evident when Everton won their last home game, against Newcastle, with their only shot on target, but many were more so during the 2-0 win at Huddersfield later that week.

They will fret over whether Thibaut Courtois and Andreas Christensen will be involved, while taking comfort in the knowledge Spurs, who have suffered one domestic defeat since November, have not won at Stamford Bridge since February 1990 and could be without Harry Kane. This has the makings of a tense occasion. Dominic Fifield",2018 mar 31,chelsea,tottenham hotspur,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/31/chelsea-tottenham-match-preview
"This is a bigger game for Stoke than Arsenal, with the home team having one eye on Thursday’s Europa League tie against CSKA Moscow. Stoke are winless in seven and have scored only four goals during that sequence; the lack of cutting edge – together with individual errors – has undermined some fighting football. The run-in feels unkind, although they do have West Ham, Crystal Palace and Swansea to come. Anything from this would be a huge bonus.

"The lesser spotted Islam Slimani is set to make his Newcastle debut at some point during this relegation battle featuring two of last season’s promoted sides. Algeria’s Slimani arrived on Tyneside for a £2m loan deal by private jet from Leicester in January but has been sidelined by a thigh injury. Expect Rafael Benítez to start him on the bench. Newcastle have enjoyed a break in Alicante and, by way of return, their manager has asked for an “early goal” and a “high-tempo start”.

"Everton are the only current Premier League team Pep Guardiola has not beaten as the Manchester City manager and there cannot be greater incentive to complete the set than the prize on the horizon that would follow a victory at Goodison Park. Three points will offer City the priceless opportunity of winning the Premier League title at home to Manchester United next weekend. It is an opportunity not to be wasted, although Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final at Liverpool may influence Guardiola’s selection.

"Both sides can, to all intents and purposes, just go out and play although Leicester could conceivably wonder whether a kind-looking run of games can heave them into faint contention for sixth place. Chris Hughton does not quite see Brighton’s position that way and hopes their next two games against Huddersfield and Crystal Palace banish any lingering relegation concerns. The omens look good: they have won their past four home matches in all competitions and pack a far greater punch in attack than earlier in the season.

"Burnley are one of only three sides to lose to West Brom in the league this season, a 1-0 win in August giving the visitors an improbable six points from six at that stage. Much has changed since and Burnley have a club-record 43 Premier League points while West Brom are 10 adrift of safety and all but relegated. “I kind of feel I owe this club,” said Alan Pardew, who has only one league win to his name since arriving at the Hawthorns in late November. “The results since I’ve been here should have been better and I’d like to come back next season with a squad that better reflects the way I play, with a bit more attacking prowess.” Burnley have won their last two games – Everton and West Ham – and with only 14 away goals conceded will be disappointed if they do not make it three in a row.

"Watford may have just about recovered from being ripped apart by Mohamed Salah before the international break. Javi Gracia will demand a response against Bournemouth, after conceding eight and failing to score in their past two matches on the road, but equally should have confidence in his side’s ability to bounce back based on their strong home record this season. Richarlison’s lack of form is a concern though. The Brazilian scored his first goal for Watford against Eddie Howe’s side in August but has failed to find the net since November.

That should spur Jürgen Klopp’s side on, even with this a nuisance of a game before the more anticipated contests against Manchester City and Everton to come. Palace, with their ranks of wounded still too numerous for comfort, will hope Christian Benteke and Mamadou Sakho have points to prove against their former club.

Wilfried Zaha is likely to start for Crystal Palace against Huddersfield after recovering from injury and the fleet-footed attacker could be crucial to his side’s chances of ending a winless run of seven matches. Respite from the relegation zone awaits if they are able to.

Who we are, what we want to achieve, what we can get,” Allardyce said. Stoke, who lost their free-hit to Manchester City 2-0 on Monday, see this as a match they can and must get three points from and with games running out, will be confident they have the wherewithal to further bamboozle Everton.

Liverpool will be eager to return to winning ways against Watford and open up a seven-point gap over Chelsea in fifth place. Jürgen Klopp’s side were undone by mistakes at Old Trafford last week and the manager could make changes as he searches for a more sturdy defensive combination that could help guide Liverpool past Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-finals in April.

"West Bromwich Albion’s time in the Premier League appears to be reaching an inevitable conclusion after another defeat, against Leicester, last week. A seventh in succession feels likely for Alan Pardew’s side, despite Gareth Barry and Jonny Evans returning, and a win for Bournemouth would give them one of the three required to confirm a fourth season in the top flight. Is there a risk of complacency for Bournemouth? “Absolutely no chance,” said Eddie Howe.

"Bournemouth become the first team to take on a wounded Tottenham who are nevertheless undefeated in 11 league games and desperate to take another step towards qualifying for the Champions League for the third season in a row. “The competition doesn’t wait for you,” said the manager, Mauricio Pochettino, reflecting on their calamitous midweek loss to Juventus. “If you’re happy or sad, the team has to move on and think about the weekend.” Bournemouth have been doing little else since their draw at Leicester last time out, with Jermain Defoe, scorer of 91 league goals for Spurs, likely to be on the bench again. “Since Christmas we have been very strong and have beaten some big teams here,” said the manager Eddie Howe, who would probably be delighted with a point this time.

"Stoke, under Mark Hughes, were humiliated 7-2 by Manchester City back in October with six different Citizens finding the net. However while Pep Guardiola’s side are the heavy favourites to win again – a repeated destruction is unlikely. Paul Lambert has brought back Stoke’s once-lauded defensive stability. They have conceded four in six games with the Scot in charge compared to 50 in the 23 preceding games this season, which provides hope in more important fixtures to come.

"Arsenal showed ‘cojones’ in the Europa League win at Milan on Thursday – something the Watford captain, Troy Deeney, accused them of lacking at Vicarage Road in October. Arsène Wenger’s players might want to prove a point to him but, really, the oomph has been knocked from their Premier League season. It is now the Europa League or bust.

"It had gone a little unnoticed that before the win over Everton last Saturday Burnley had gone 11 Premier League games and almost three months without a win. If Sean Dyche’s side can also triumph at West Ham on Saturday they can move to within two points of sixth-placed Arsenal. Joe Hart, meanwhile, has been thrown a World Cup lifeline by David Moyes. The goalkeeper’s England spot for this summer’s tournament in Russia has been in jeopardy since he lost his place at West Ham in December following some inconsistent performances.

"Mauricio Pellegrino said he will “always be grateful” to Rafael Benítez but he cannot afford to do his mentor any favours in this relegation six pointer. Southampton’s manager, whose side have won only one of their past 16 league games, played for Benítez at Valencia and Liverpool before later joining the Anfield coaching staff and then assisting the Spaniard at Internazionale. “Rafa’s a good example to me both professionally and personally,” Pellegrino said. “He also gave me the opportunity to work as an assistant manager.” Louise Taylor",2018 mar 09,newcastle united,southampton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/09/newcastle-southampton-match-preview
"The ailing champions have long been spying this match as potential relief in amid games with Barcelona and the two Manchester clubs, but they have lost to Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge in each of the last two seasons. This match may come too soon for Wilfried Zaha to start for Palace but he has been the scourge of Chelsea in recent times.

Goodison Park may well be hostile – “We are absolutely aware of that,” Allardyce said – but there is also need for unity, however temporary, with Stoke away, Manchester City and Liverpool on the horizon.

A run of five successive defeats speaks for itself but they have performed miracles to stay in the league before.

West Bromwich Albion are frozen at the bottom of the table after a run of four successive league defeats and victory at Watford is imperative to avoid their plight deepening further.

José Mourinho has guided Manchester United to only one win against a direct rival this season – the 3-1 victory at Arsenal in early December.

Brighton are five places above them but only three points ahead and Chris Hughton’s side are one of those Lambert will be hoping to reel in over the final 12 games. Saturday would be a good place to start. Paul Chronnell,2018 feb 09,stoke city,brighton & hove albion,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/09/stoke-brighton-match-preview
Harry Kane vs Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is at the top of the bill but this is a fascinating clash on so many levels and it has the trappings of a six-pointer in terms of the race for a top-four finish. Tottenham have come to feel at home at Wembley but Arsenal have won on each of their previous nine visits to the national stadium. How Arsène Wenger’s side need to find some stability and personality away from home. David Hytner,2018 feb 09,tottenham hotspur,arsenal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/09/tottenham-arsenal-match-preview
Watford will be full of confidence after walloping Chelsea on Monday night. Javi Gracia is settling in nicely after replacing Marco Silva and Watford visit a West Ham side who are three points above the bottom three after last weekend’s defeat at Brighton. David Moyes desperately needs his players to show some fight. At least the arrival of Patrice Evra on a free transfer might help in that regard.

"Apologies are required all round from Everton as they attempt to put breathing space between themselves and Roy Hodgson’s injury-hit team. Sam Allardyce owes one to Hodgson having not contacted his England predecessor personally in the 17 months since being caught mocking his speech. Everton’s players also need to atone for their apology of a performance, and latest in a series of capitulations, at Arsenal last weekend. Palace are missing nine senior players through injury and Goodison Park will be short on forgiveness should Everton fail to capitalise on their good fortune.

"Neither Rafael Benítez or Roy Hodgson will be satisfied with their business in the transfer window, though the possibility of Islam Slimani playing some part at Selhurst Park may cheer the Spaniard. Hodgson has now lost Bakary Sako to a broken ankle, a sixth long-term absentee, until into next season and may have to turn sooner than he would have liked to his three young new signings.

"Tottenham will arrive on a high following defeat of Manchester United plus a comprehensive victory over Liverpool at Wembley in October. Since that 4-1 reverse, however, Jürgen Klopp’s side have lost only once in 16 league games, scoring 43 goals in that period, and arrested a recent dip with victory at Huddersfield. Only two points separate the teams in the race for Champions League qualification and it would be a significant step towards that goal for Liverpool should they repeat the heights of their last home league display against Manchester City.

"Things looked so good for both these clubs last May. Antonio Conte was basking in leading Chelsea to the title in his first season while Watford secured the services of Marco Silva ahead of a host of other suitors. Wind the clock forward nine months, however, and things have unravelled both in west London and Hertfordshire, with Silva gone and replaced last month by Javi Gracia and Conte seemingly talking his way to the exit door at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea do, however, remain in the top four but Spurs are breathing down their necks and Conte’s side could use a return to winning ways on Monday after the disastrous defeat to Bournemouth.

"A match that threatens to be overshadowed by the absence of Riyad Mahrez, who has not reported for training at Leicester since he missed out on a move to Manchester City and will play no part here. How unsettling that whole episode has been for Leicester, who are unbeaten at home since mid-December, remains to be seen. Swansea are unlikely to be able to call on new-signing Andre Ayew, who is a major doubt, but Carlos Carvalhal’s side will travel with confidence after back-to-back wins over Liverpool and Arsenal.

"After the mid-week 2-0 humbling from Tottenham, Manchester United face a side they were poor against earlier in the season, Huddersfield Town, losing 2-1 in October’s reverse fixture. That had been United’s worst performance until the defeat at Wembley and as they are only five points better off than Spurs in fifth, the demand is to bounce straight back and claim victory as Champions League qualification is the absolute minimum required.

Burnley are still seventh in the table and best of the rest even if Sean Dyche’s side have now gone eight league matches without a win and will be hard pushed to buck that trend against Manchester City – who beat them 4-1 in the FA Cup last month.

It will certainly be strange to see Theo Walcott in an Everton shirt at the Emirates but plenty has changed for Arsenal after a frenetic January. The hope is the shake-up can re-energise the club. One thing Arsène Wenger wants to maintain is his side’s impressive home form. He is vexed by the wild contrast to their away results. Walcott may fancy vexing him some more after helping Everton to end a wretched run on Wednesday with two goals in the win over Leicester City.

"Brighton have only claimed victory three times at home this season and their position is beginning to look complicated. The visit of West Ham, blighted by injury and off-field problems, looks like a good opportunity to end their six-match winless run. Record signing Jürgen Locadia is not ready for involvement just yet, although he has begun training, but Leonardo Ulloa should get some minutes on returning to his old home.

"West Brom are bottom of the table and cannot afford to lose to Southampton who also reside in the relegation zone. Alan Pardew simply needs his side to score more goals and the manager will hope Daniel Sturridge’s finishing can instantly fill the void.

Tottenham are unbeaten in five while Southampton’s winless league run stretches to 10 games – including a 5-2 Boxing Day thrashing by Spurs. The home side’s only win over Spurs since returning to the Premier League came in May 2016, and was also their last league win over a side in the current top six. Mauricio Pellegrino’s focus now is on the bottom six – Southampton play the other five teams presently in that bracket in the next seven games, so anything gained on Sunday will be a bonus.

"Carlos Carvalhal strayed into “David and Goliath” territory when he was talking about this fixture, which provides a measure of what he feels Swansea are up against. Liverpool put five past them on Boxing Day, two days before Carvalhal was appointed, and their 4-3 victory over Manchester City last weekend provided more evidence of their devastating attacking ability. Mohamed Salah has recovered from illness in time to face Swansea and Virgil van Dijk is also available again. Renato Sanches is back in contention for Swansea.

"Stoke City need the fabled new manager bounce as they fight to remain in the top flight for a 10th successive season. Alex Pritchard made an impact from the bench on his home debut for Huddersfield and will be looking to expose Stoke’s porous defence.

Theo Walcott will add some much needed pace and will oppose his former team-mate Kieran Gibbs.

The reverse fixture on Boxing Day saw Sean Dyche’s side take a two goal lead at Old Trafford, before Jesse Lingard salvaged a point for United with two goals. Lingard’s heroics have become a recurring theme for José Mourinho’s team, but Burnley have not won at home since early December so the England international may not be leaned on quite as heavily.

"While both sides remain in a relegation battle, the winner of this game could be in ninth place at the end of the weekend. Such are the fine margins in the Premier League’s crammed lower reaches. West Ham are on an upward trajectory after thrashing Huddersfield Town and will be confident of gaining revenge for Callum Wilson’s controversial equaliser in their 3-3 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day.

"Three weeks after a sole Raheem Sterling strike won the reverse fixture Pep Guardiola’s side welcome Newcastle United.

At some point a landmark result may be needed for a team that has won just once in 12 league games and has been dragged towards the bottom three. Chris Hughton hopes to add firepower by signing Jürgen Locadia from PSV, although he would not be available on Saturday; it might be some comfort that any Chelsea move for Peter Crouch will not take place in time either.

Arsène Wenger has described the current January window as the most disturbing and destabilising he has known and the noises around a clutch of transfer and contractual situations remain loud. Arsenal must block them out against Roy Hodgson’s resurgent Crystal Palace. What was most disturbing for Wenger’s team in last Sunday’s defeat at Bournemouth was the sterile possession and lack of creativity. Palace will look to be compact. Arsenal must find the answers.

"How Arsène Wenger, who will again be peering from the stands, would love a victory after the nightmare in Nottingham. Arsenal are winless in four in all competitions – their longest barren run since a streak of five starting in February 2016 – and that could easily continue. Eddie Howe can count on making chances with ease against Wenger’s notional defence and that could be enough as the burden of Arsenal’s successes may no longer be able to lie squarely on Alexis Sánchez’s shoulders.

West Bromwich Albion finally ended their marathon run without a win in all competitions last time out but that was against League Two’s Exeter. Alan Pardew has an ideal chance to build on that against Brighton and to spark a revival as Chris Hughton’s side have scored just five goals on the road this season.

Rafael Benítez is still in the dark about his January transfer budget and does not sound tremendously optimistic about the prospect of actually signing any players this month. Throw in mounting uncertainties about Newcastle’s mooted takeover and Benítez looks to have almost as many problems as Swansea’s Carlos Carvalhal before a relegation six-pointer both managers could desperately do with winning.

Brighton are experiencing their first rocky patch since coming up and after such a good start have begun to look rather like a promoted side – conceding sloppy goals and failing to put chances away.

Mauricio Pellegrino is expected to stick with in-form striker Charlie Austin despite Shane Long recovering from a calf problem as he looks to improve that record.

A Champions League quarter-final at Atlético Madrid looms for the champions and rotation poses a dilemma for Craig Shakespeare after having picked a settled side during his flawless start in the job. Leicester’s prospects of a seventh successive victory in all competitions since the departure of Claudio Ranieri have been enhanced by an Everton defence depleted by injury and suspension.

Relegation is the faintest of concerns but one more victory should banish any such thoughts and set their sights towards the top half once more.

"What might have been a relegation six-pointer at the beginning of the season is not because Burnley’s home form has been imperious. Their away form continues to be awful though, with just one point earned on their travels. Such travails will not be helped by an injury to Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Jeff Hendrick’s ban. Marco Silva’s resurgent side will be missing Sam Clucas through suspension but are otherwise likely to boast a side unchanged from the one that lost narrowly to Arsenal.

"Antonio Conte will consider this an opportunity to stretch Chelsea’s imposing lead at the top of the Premier League but Swansea are hugely improved and are now overseen by two former Blues. Claude Makelele will be afforded a huge ovation on his return as one of Paul Clement’s assistants. Carlo Ancelotti’s former No2 has won four of six league games and his side can sense a route to safety. “Now it’s about asking: ‘How much do we want to avoid suffering at the end of the season?’” said Clement.

"This may be Crystal Palace’s last chance to turn their season around. Middlesbrough, supremely stingy but without an away win since August, arrive at Selhurst Park hoping to emulate Sunderland’s recent saunter in south London by tapping into Palace’s insecurities at home.

David Moyes returns to Goodison Park for the first time since a 2-0 defeat in April 2014 marked the end of his reign at Manchester United. He can ill-afford another demoralising match against his former club.

"While rivals head to the Gulf for warm-weather training next week, David Moyes is taking his players on a bonding break to sub-zero, snowy, New York. It seems illogical but as they proved by crushing Crystal Palace away last Saturday, Sunderland have a penchant for the unexpected.

Paul Clement has been named manager of the month for January and Claudio Ranieri has received the dreaded vote of confidence – in that context both men could be forgiven for feeling cursed before this pivotal meeting.

Will Pep Guardiola drop Sergio Agüero and Claudio Bravo for a second match in a row? Can the Manchester City manager somehow plot his way to a third win over Swansea City this season? The first question comes after the striker and the No1 keeper were left out for the 4-0 win at West Ham United. The second because Guardiola talked up Paul Clement’s impact since taking over four games ago.

"“I’ve spent two and a half years at this club and he’s not my problem anymore. I wish him all the best.” These were the words spoken by Tony Pulis on Saido Berahino – the pantomime villain of The Hawthorns after his overdue departure.

"Liverpool have won their past four matches, the most recent of which was against Manchester City. Sunderland are in poor form and lost 4-1 at Burnley last time out. There should, then, be only one winner. But with the visitors having less than 44 hours to prepare for this game and possibly lacking Jordan Henderson through injury, the hosts may sense they can cause an upset.

Watford have chanced upon an ideal time to play Tottenham. Jan Vertonghen and Kyle Walker are suspended and Toby Alderweireld may still be feeling the after-effects of a virus. However in Watford’s past six matches they have failed to score three times and scored more than one goal just once in the other three. Tottenham’s replacements will not be quaking in their boots.

"Undoubtedly the Christmas cracker of a festive program lacking in high-profile encounters. Liverpool and Manchester City do battle for second place. Both sides are so evenly matched, explosive in attack and liable to blunders at the back, that a coin toss might be the most effective way of choosing the victor.

The absence of Jordan Pickford, Sunderland’s breakout star of 2016, may help them as Vito Mannone could be rusty after not featuring since 21 August.

This match – along with Southampton’s duel with Everton on 2 January – will have a bearing on which side collects the notional ‘best of the rest’ award at the end of the season for finishing just below the Premier League title-chasers.

Back-to-back wins over Middlesbrough and Sunderland cannot be discounted given their impressive home form, and might also help Sean Dyche attract the right January reinforcements. Their first festive test sees a rematch with last season’s Championship rivals Boro, with whom they shared a draw at Turf Moor in April.

Given the season it would be heartening to witness David Moyes receive a warm reception from Manchester United fans on his first return to Old Trafford since his sacking two years ago.

There could be worse places for Sam Allardyce to take charge of his first game as Crystal Palace manager – his new club have a remarkable record at Vicarage Road having won six times and lost only once in their past 10 league visits.

If other results go their way Bilic’s side could climb into the top half of the Premier League table.

A punishing schedule of three matches in six days would suggest Southampton have somehow got themselves on the Premier League fixture computer’s naughty list this year.

The stoppage time win at Everton felt like a defining three points for Jürgen Klopp’s team but they need to maintain pressure on Chelsea over the festive period to confirm as much.

It may sound unbelievable but Tony Pulis, frequently maligned for negative tactics, has his side playing with attacking verve and as a result they have scored one more goal than Manchester United in the league leaving them one place behind the visitors in seventh.

The hosts have the joint worst home record in the division and are undermined by injuries, with Alan Pardew still a manager very much under pressure.

Crystal Palace arrive at Hull City following a morale-boosting 3-0 win against Southampton that ended their run of six straight defeats. No such respite for the hosts who have seen everything go downhill since their transfer embargo was lifted and they began signing players.

The former England coach could do with building on Tuesday’s spirited draw against Manchester United by beating his one time Croatia counterpart but West Ham have their sights on Europe – and Dimitri Payet back in midfield. With Jonjo Shelvey likely to make his Newcastle debut in the same department an interesting subplot looms.

Southampton are feeling much better about themselves after beating Watford on Wednesday night and the visit of West Bromwich Albion presents them with a good chance to win consecutive matches for the first time since early November.

Although Steve McClaren’s side have shown signs of definite improvement in recent weeks they remain fourth bottom – not great for a club whose declared pre-season target was a top eight place.

Bournemouth supporters will switch their attentions to Mick Cunningham after 55 minutes, in which they will start a minute’s applause in memory of the former club photographer, who collapsed whilst at work during the first half at Stoke.

This week’s capture of the Swiss international Gokhan Inler for £5m added to the happy vibes that Leicester City have been emitting since their dashing start to the season under Claudio Ranieri. It will be interesting to whether Inler’s arrival will lead to the manager tinkering with a line-up that has recorded wins in their first two matches.

Arsène Wenger will shudder at the memory of his last visit, February’s 5-1 humiliation that holed his then Premier League leaders’ title credentials and reinforced Liverpool’s own in the process.

David Moyes’s branding of Liverpool as favourites against Manchester United at Old Trafford for last season’s edition of this fixture hardly enamoured the Scot to fans. In Louis van Gaal they now have a manager to believe in and he “welcomes” Brendan Rodgers’ side seeking a six consecutive win.

Newcastle begin an important week with a visit to one of their bogey teams. They have beaten Arsenal only once in 17 meetings and Alan Pardew has lost on each of his three visits with the club to the Emirates.

"While Stoke fans like nothing more than cheering on their team to victory over Arsenal, as they did last weekend, it is probably fair to say their manager would get particular pleasure from putting one over Neil Warnock’s team.

"Brendan Rodgers made some disparaging remarks about Mario Balotelli’s recent performances after losing away to Basel in midweek in the Champions League. Maybe the Liverpool boss will regret not picking up Danny Welbeck instead. However if Balotelli turns around Liverpool’s recent run of poor form by spearheading a first league win in four games against an improving West Brom side then, you can be sure, Rodgers and Liverpool fans will be smiling again.

"Hull are the definition of mid-table, as they are 10th and have a goal difference of zero.

Cissé’s two goals against Hull last Saturday may have saved the Newcastle manager’s job – at least for now – but Pardew might have been under a lot less pressure if the Senegal striker had contributed more than 21 minutes of playing time so far this season.

Both sides have opted for a revamp over the summer – West Bromwich Albion have made eight signings and allowed 13 players to leave while Sunderland have brought in six new faces and let 16 go. This match could provide an early indication of whether the changes will produce results at either club in the weeks to come. If they do not then both managers could easily find themselves battling relegation this season.

We are told he was merely busy elsewhere – as a fortnight has passed since City last won a game and with David Silva, Mancini's go-to lock-picker doubtful as he recovers from a hamstring problem, the Italian may have been plotting how to get his side finally to spark.

They certainly need a response to the dreadful display that contributed to the League Cup exit at Leeds United in midweek to maintain the early-season optimism around Goodison Park. Southampton, inspired on and off the pitch by two Liverpool fans, manager Nigel Adkins and striker Rickie Lambert, will be buoyed by their overdue first win of the season last week and new signing Artur Boruc could make his debut in goal.

Roberto Mancini's side arrive at Craven Cottage, where they dropped their first points last term, without a clean sheet and feeling vulnerable. Fulham have won this fixture only once since these teams met in the third tier back in 1998, but they have rallied in recent weeks. Dimitar Berbatov's absence is a considerable blow, but both their home games have been won emphatically. They can test City's fragile form.

Nemanja Vidic's knee injury means Ferguson is down to his last two senior centre-backs in Jonny Evans and Rio Ferdinand, and with the latter's need to manage a back condition, André Villas-Boas will ask his resurgent Tottenham side to drive at the home defence.

Record signing Gastón Ramírez is in line for his full debut after coming off the bench against Arsenal last week and Nigel Adkins may also contemplate dropping Jos Hooiveld, who is struggling with a calf problem and has made several costly errors recently. The hosts' porous defence could be tested by Christian Benteke, who scored the second in Aston Villa's win over Swansea, and Darren Bent, looking for his first Premier League goal since February.

With an emphatic 3-1 victory over Reading last Sunday and a well-earned draw against Lazio on Thursday, Tottenham have certainly allayed some of the fears building in north London. Villas-Boas faces a goalkeeping dilemma, but is expected to retain Brad Friedel ahead of the £12m summer signing, Hugo Lloris, who made his debut against Lazio, who was granted his first start this week. Languishing in the relegation zone, QPR's new-look team are still seeking their first league win with Anton Ferdinand and Fábio da Silva both ruled out for two weeks.

Chelsea loanee Romelu Lukaku, with a goal to his name already against Liverpool, will look to fill in, but the more versatile Marc-Antoine Fortuné may be preferred.

After two classy goals on his home debut, Dimitar Berbatov will lead the line once more for Fulham.

With three draws thus far, Sunderland demonstrated their tenacity and organisation last week to steal a point against a dominant Liverpool, but Martin O'Neill will still be worried by an 11-match winless run, stretching back to May. In contrast, West Ham can boast a 100 per cent home record this season, with Jussi Jaaskelainen – secured on a free transfer at the tender age of 37 – yet to concede at Upton Park.

Michael Owen will hope for a first league start after a brief substitute cameo last weekend but Andy Wilkinson starts a three-match ban following his clash with Mario Balotelli.

Hughton, however, will be going all out to beat his friend, and much could hinge on the potential success of a new forward partnership between Grant Holt and Robert Snodgrass.

The questions will remain as to whether progress has been made – the club's trophy drought seems to have been temporarily overlooked – but a powerful finish would fire optimism for the future.

A vast improvement is needed and it will help that Sergio Agüero, Joleon Lescott and Samir Nasri, returning to his former club, are back.

"Arsène Wenger has history with Alan Pardew and he is not inclined to hand out compliments to him. The pair clashed in November 2006 after Pardew's West Ham had scored a late winner against Arsenal. Yet Wenger prepared to welcome the Newcastle manager with a ringing endorsement of his team's style and ""fantastic attitude"", together with his business on the transfer market, name-checking the club's attacking and creative talents. Only a cynic would suggest that Wenger was encouraging Pardew to carry the game to Arsenal. The visitors have struggled on their three trips to the capital this season.

"This match, together with the meeting of Bolton and QPR at the Reebok Stadium, will have a huge bearing on who survives in the top flight this season. Any three of the current bottom five could easily find themselves in the relegation zone come May so any points taken from their closest rivals will be crucial. Without a home win since 4 December, and with 12 goals conceded in their last three Premier League games, the Wolves caretaker manager, Terry Connor, was facing a difficult enough job even before an injury to Karl Henry and a bout of indiscipline from the captain, Roger Johnson. Connor remains confident he can keep the club in the division despite these setbacks. Only time will tell.

A win in the early kick-off on Saturday could provide a long period of relaxation for either Owen Coyle or Mark Hughes; a loss and it will a long morale-sapping trip to the next match. Both of these sides are very much in the relegation mix – a slim goal margin keeps Bolton off the bottom while the same keeps QPR out of the drop zone. Rangers' record on the road might give Bolton some hope though – they have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their last 10 away games and have taken just two points from the last seven of those matches.

Norwich were unable to survive that year and Wigan, runners-up in the second tier, replaced them in the top flight. If Roberto Martínez's team hope to produce a miracle that Saturday's hosts could not seven years ago, they will have to start by somehow conjuring a win against a side that is comfortable in mid-table and has been playing well, despite back-to-back defeats at the hands of Manchester United and Stoke respectively.

The question to Harry Redknapp was almost an apologetic after-thought. Any injuries? Everyone laughed. How could the Tottenham manager be asked anything so trivial as to which players might be available when he was living in the eye of a storm? It rather summed up the problem facing his club. As Redknapp is pushed as the England manager-in-waiting – following the end of his crown court dramas – he and Tottenham must battle to retain their focus. Newcastle will prove a stern test. There was a cruel reaction in some quarters to Alan Pardew ruling himself out of the England jobbut he was only responding to a question and the work he has done at Newcastle has been estimable.

Newcastle's visit to the Etihad Stadium brings an unexpected collision of high-flying mutual excellence. The Premier League's two remaining unbeaten records are on the line as the division's meanest defence – Alan Pardew's keenly-drilled all-sorts – meets the most prolific attack. There have been suggestions Newcastle's run is rooted in an unusually clement run of fixtures and that Saturday's game will give a clearer indication of their quality.

One of three sides to win at the Stadium of Light last season, Villa will aim to deny Simon Mignolet, Sunderland's Belgian Under-21 goalkeeper who continues to keep Scotland's Craig Gordon on the bench, a third straight clean sheet.

"Turf Moor thrived on its first top-flight game for 33 years and Owen Coyle's team will be confident of continuing the momentum that stunned Manchester United. Coyle's fellow Scot, David Moyes, must hope the final hour against Sigma Olomouc in the Europa League marked a U-turn in Everton's early season form but, with the Joleon Lescott saga ongoing, Phil Neville required as an emergency central defender and still no reinforcements in place, the visitors face an arduous task to recover from their Arsenal humbling.

"If Birmingham are to stay in the Premier League for more than their usual season this is the sort of home fixture they need to win on a regular basis. Stoke can be sticky opponents but their away record was poor last season and even a point at St Andrew's today would be a small triumph. With Grégory Vignal and Cameron Jerome carrying knocks Alex McLeish may have to make changes, one of which would mean a start up front for record-signing Christian Benítez. Lee Bowyer is set to play in midfield after completing a suspension.

"Peter Storrie says he has a mystery new backer who will fund a rescue act at Portsmouth. The club would then, presumably, be in a position to meet its scheduled loan repayment of £24-36m by Monday week, meaning it would not have to sell more players and the only way would be up. Excellent. The pessimistic reading as push comes to shove at Fratton Park is somewhat darker. Thank goodness then for respite today, with 90 minutes against a struggling team, whose confidence has been shot to piece by the naysayers. Hang on a minute...

"As a former Newcastle United manager, Blackburn's Sam Allardyce can expect a hot reception. Steve Bruce, meanwhile, anticipates a somewhat gruelling afternoon. ""Sam is very, very well organised and his teams play to a system which is not always easy on the eye but is very effective,"" said Sunderland's manager. ""But these are the games we are going to be judged on."" This is the home side's third match in a week and, with injuries mounting, it will be intriguing to see if Bruce offers fit crowd favourite Andy Reid a start.
